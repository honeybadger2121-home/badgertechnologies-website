## Module 4: Cold Outreach That Works



### Cold Calling Best Practices


**Mindset:**

- You're helping, not selling

- Rejection is normal (expect 95% no)

- Every "no" gets you closer to "yes"

- Stay positive and energetic

- Track and improve


**Preparation:**

- Research the company (5 minutes)

- Know decision maker's name

- Prepare opening hook

- Have calendar ready

- Clear goal: schedule discovery call


**Cold Call Structure:**

**Opening (10 seconds):**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Badger Technologies. How are you today?"

[Brief pause for response]

**Hook (15 seconds):**
"I'm calling because we work with [similar companies in their industry] to protect them from cyber threats and prevent costly IT downtime. I noticed [specific observation about their business]."

**Permission (5 seconds):**
"Do you have 30 seconds for me to explain why I'm calling?"

**Value Statement (30 seconds):**
"We specialize in helping [industry] companies like yours with [specific pain point]. Most businesses we talk to are concerned about [ransomware/downtime/security]. We've helped companies like [similar client] reduce IT costs by 30% while improving security."

**Qualifying Question:**
"Are you currently satisfied with your IT support and cybersecurity?"

**Listen and Adapt:**
[Based on response, dig deeper or pivot]

**Call to Action:**
"I'd love to offer you a complimentary IT security assessment—we'll identify any vulnerabilities and show you how to protect your business. Do you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call?"

**Sample Cold Call Scripts:**

**Script 1: Security Focused**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Badger Technologies. The reason I'm calling is that ransomware attacks on [their industry] businesses have increased 300% this year. We've been helping local companies protect themselves, and I wanted to reach out to see if cybersecurity is something you're taking seriously. Are you currently confident in your business's security measures?"

**Script 2: Downtime/Reliability**
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] here from Badger Technologies. I work with [industry] companies to eliminate IT downtime and keep teams productive. Quick question—when your computers or network go down, how long does it typically take to get back up and running?"

**Script 3: Cost/Efficiency**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Badger Technologies. We specialize in helping businesses like yours reduce IT costs while improving reliability. Most companies we work with are overspending on technology and still dealing with frequent problems. Would you be open to a free assessment to see if there's room for improvement?"


### Handling Gatekeepers


**Be Respectful and Professional:**
"Good morning! This is [Your Name] with Badger Technologies. I'm calling to speak with [Decision Maker] about their IT security. Is he/she available?"

**If They Ask What It's About:**
"I'm following up regarding cybersecurity solutions for [Company]. Is [Decision Maker] the right person to discuss IT services?"

**If They Offer to Take a Message:**

**Build Relationship:**
"I really appreciate your help! What's your name? [Remember it!] Thanks, [Gatekeeper Name]. When's the best time to call back?"

I don't want to be a pest! Should I assume:
a) You're all set with IT and security

Just let me know and I'll respect your wishes.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

### Pricing Strategies


**Value-Based Pricing:**
Don't compete on price—compete on value.

**Frame Investment vs. Current Costs:**
```
Current Situation:

- Break-fix IT: $6,000/year (unpredictable)

- Downtime: 2 days/year = $15,000 lost productivity

- Security risk: Potential $200K+ from breach

- Total Risk: $221,000+


Our Solution:

- Managed Services: $30,000/year (predictable)

- Eliminate most downtime: Save $12,000

- Reduce security risk: Priceless

- Net Difference: $18,000/year investment for $233,000 protection

```

**ROI Examples:**

**Productivity Gains:**
"Our clients typically see 20% improvement in IT productivity. For your 25 employees at an average salary of $50,000, that's $250,000 in total payroll. A 20% improvement = $50,000 in gained productivity. Our service costs $36,000/year. ROI = 39%."

**Downtime Prevention:**
"You mentioned downtime costs you about $5,000 per day. Last year you had 3 significant outages = $15,000. Our monitoring prevents 90% of issues. Save $13,500 + gain peace of mind. Our service is $30,000/year, pays for itself in 2 years just from downtime prevention alone."

**Security Protection:**
"The average ransomware attack costs $200,000+ (ransom, recovery, lost business). Our advanced security suite costs $8,000/year. If we prevent just ONE attack in 25 years, it's paid for itself. Most businesses face multiple attempts per year."

## Module 8: Overcoming Objections



### Common Objections & Responses


**Objection 1: "It's too expensive"**

**Response:**
"I understand—it's an investment. Let me ask: what are you spending now?"

[They tell you]

"OK, so you're spending $X per year on break-fix support, plus you mentioned losing $Y to downtime. That's $Z total. Our solution is $A per month = $B per year. The difference is only $C, and for that you get 24/7 monitoring, proactive maintenance, and peace of mind. Plus, we'll reduce your downtime by 90%, saving you $Y2. Actually, you'll save money while getting better service. Does that make sense?"

**Alternative Response:**
"Too expensive compared to what? Fixing problems after they happen, or preventing them? The real question is: what does downtime cost your business?"

---

**Objection 2: "We need to think about it"**

**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. Can I ask—what specifically do you need to think about? Is it the investment, the timeline, or something else?"

[They explain]

"I appreciate that. Let me address [their concern]. [Provide information]. What would make you comfortable moving forward?"

**Alternative Response:**
"I understand. What questions can I answer to help your decision? [Address]. How about we start with a 90-day trial? If you're not completely satisfied, we part as friends. Fair enough?"

---

**Objection 3: "We're happy with our current IT person/company"**

**Response:**
"That's great that you have someone! I'm curious—are they available 24/7? Do they provide proactive monitoring? What's their average response time?"

[Usually reveals gaps]

"Here's the thing: we work alongside internal IT people all the time. They handle day-to-day items, we provide enterprise-level support, after-hours coverage, and strategic planning. Many clients use us as a backup to their IT person. That way, there's no single point of failure. Would that model work for you?"

**Alternative Response:**
"I respect that relationship. Let me ask—what happens when they're on vacation or sick? What's your backup plan? We often serve as the backup tier for businesses with internal IT. No obligation to switch—just another resource when needed."

---

**Objection 4: "We're too small for managed services"**

**Response:**
"Actually, small businesses benefit most from managed services because:

1. You don't have an IT department to fall back on

2. You can't afford extended downtime

3. Cybercriminals target small businesses (easier targets)

4. You get enterprise-level protection at small business prices


We work with businesses your exact size. You get the same security and support that Fortune 500 companies have, scaled for your needs. Isn't that exactly what you need?"

---

**Objection 5: "We just need someone for emergencies"**

**Response:**
"I understand that's how most businesses think about IT. But here's the problem with that approach:

Break-Fix Model:

- Wait for things to break

- Pay premium for emergency service

- Experience downtime and lost productivity

- Unpredictable costs

- Reactive and stressful


Managed Services:

- Prevent issues before they happen

- Included in monthly fee

- Minimal downtime

- Predictable budget

- Proactive and stress-free


Which sounds better for your business? Plus, if you calculate what you spend annually on emergency fixes plus the cost of downtime, our managed services usually cost the same or less."

---

**Objection 6: "Can you send me a quote?"**

**Response:**
"I could send you a quote, but it wouldn't be accurate without understanding your specific needs. Every business is different. I'd hate to quote too high and scare you off, or too low and not be able to deliver what you need.

How about this: let's schedule a quick 15-minute call where I ask a few questions about your setup. Then I can put together a customized proposal that actually addresses your needs. Do you have 15 minutes this week?"

---

**Objection 7: "We're comparing you with other providers"**

**Response:**
"Smart! You should compare. Let me make sure you're comparing apples to apples. What specifically are you comparing?"

[They explain]

"Great. When you compare, make sure to ask:

- Are they available 24/7 or just business hours?

- Do they provide proactive monitoring or just break-fix?

- What's their average response time?

- Do they have experience in your industry?

- What's included vs. what costs extra?

- Do they provide strategic planning?


We're confident that when you compare the total value, not just price, we're the clear choice. What questions can I answer about our services?"

---

**Objection 8: "We need to talk to our partner/board/spouse"**

**Response:**
"Of course! Who else is involved in this decision?"

[They explain]

"Would it be helpful if I presented to everyone at once? I can explain the technology and answer their questions. That way everyone hears the same information and we can address all concerns together. When could we get everyone together for 20 minutes?"

**Alternative:**
"What questions do you think they'll have? Let me help you answer those now so you have all the information you need."

---

**Objection 9: "We can't afford downtime for the transition"**

**Response:**
"I completely understand—that's why our implementation is designed for zero disruption. Here's how we do it:


1. We monitor and support your existing setup first

2. We make changes during off-hours or weekends

3. We migrate services in phases, not all at once

4. We thoroughly test before switching over

5. Your team won't even notice most changes


One client told us: 'We didn't realize you'd switched everything over until you told us.' That's our goal—seamless transition. Would that address your concern?"

---

**Objection 10: "We had a bad experience with another IT company"**

**Response:**
"I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"

[Listen to their story]

"I completely understand your hesitation. Unfortunately, that's more common than it should be. Here's how we're different:


- [Address their specific issue]

- Dedicated account manager (not just a ticket number)

- Transparent communication

- No long-term contracts (month-to-month after initial period)

- Guaranteed response times

- Regular check-ins and reviews


How about we start with a 90-day trial? That gives you time to see how we operate without a long-term commitment. If we don't exceed your expectations, we part ways. Does that sound fair?"

---


### Objection Handling Framework


**Step 1: Listen**
Don't interrupt. Let them fully explain their concern.

**Step 2: Acknowledge**
"I understand..." / "That makes sense..." / "I appreciate that..."

**Step 3: Clarify**
"Can you tell me more about that?" / "What specifically concerns you?"

**Step 4: Respond**
Address their actual concern with logic and examples.

**Step 5: Confirm**
"Does that address your concern?" / "What else is holding you back?"

**Step 6: Close**
Move forward: "So shall we get started?"

## Module 9: Closing Techniques



### When to Close


**Buying Signals:**

- Asking about implementation timeline

- Wanting to see the agreement

- Asking about specific features

- Discussing internally

- "What happens next?"

- Relaxed body language

- Taking detailed notes


**Don't wait for perfect moment—ask for the business!**


### Closing Techniques


**Assumptive Close:**
Act as if they've already decided.

"Great! Let's get the paperwork started. I'll send over the agreement today and we can begin next Monday. Sound good?"

---

**Alternative Close:**
Give them options (both lead to yes).

"Would you prefer to start with the Professional or Premium package?"

"Should we schedule the assessment for Thursday or would next Tuesday work better?"

---

**Summary Close:**
Recap benefits, then ask.

"So we've established that you need better security, 24/7 support, and predictable costs. Our Professional Plan gives you all of that for $2,800/month. Shall I get the agreement prepared?"

---

**Urgency Close:**
Create legitimate urgency.

"We have availability to start next week, but our schedule fills up fast. If we can get the agreement signed by Friday, I can block out time for your implementation. Does that work?"

---

**Trial Close:**
Test the waters throughout conversation.

"If we could solve [problem] for [price], would you move forward?"

"Does this sound like what you're looking for?"

"Are we on the right track?"

---

**Direct Close:**
Simply ask for the business.

"Based on everything we've discussed, I think we're a great fit. Are you ready to get started?"

---

**Ben Franklin Close:**
Pros/cons list.

"Let's list the pros and cons of moving forward. [Create list—pros should outweigh cons]. Based on this, what makes sense?"

---

**Puppy Dog Close:**
Let them try it.

"How about a 90-day trial? You can experience our service with no long-term commitment. If we don't exceed expectations, we part as friends. What do you say?"

---


### After They Say Yes


**1. Confirm the Decision:**
"Excellent! I'm excited to partner with you."

**2. Set Expectations:**
"Here's what happens next: I'll send over the agreement today. Once signed, we'll schedule your onboarding call and begin monitoring your systems within 48 hours."

**3. Send Agreement Immediately:**
Strike while the iron is hot. Don't wait.

**4. Schedule Next Steps:**
Book the onboarding call right away.

**5. Thank Them:**
"Thank you for trusting us with your technology. We won't let you down."

---


### When They Say No


**1. Understand Why:**
"I appreciate your honesty. Can I ask what led to your decision?"

**2. Address Final Concerns:**
One last attempt to overcome objections.

**3. Leave Door Open:**
"I understand. Can I stay in touch? Situations change, and I'd love to help if your needs change."

**4. Ask for Referrals:**
"I completely respect your decision. Do you know anyone else who might benefit from our services?"

**5. Follow Up:**
Add to nurture campaign. Check back in 3-6 months.
