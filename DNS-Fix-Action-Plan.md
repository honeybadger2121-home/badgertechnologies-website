# DNS Issues Fix - Action Items

## CRITICAL - Fix DMARC Record Name (Typo)

**Current Problem:** You have `_dmar.badgertechnologies.us` in your DNS
**Required Fix:** Change it to `_dmarc.badgertechnologies.us` (add the 'c')

**Steps:**
1. Login to Name.com DNS management
2. Find the TXT record for `_dmar.badgertechnologies.us`
3. Edit the host name to `_dmarc.badgertechnologies.us`
4. Keep the same value: `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:admin@badgertechnologies.us; ruf=mailto:admin@badgertechnologies.us; sp=quarantine; adkim=r; aspf=r; fo=1`

## DNS Server Configuration Issues

**Problems Found:**
- Primary Name Server Not Listed At Parent
- Name Servers are on the Same Subnet
- SOA Serial Number Format is Invalid

**Action Required:**
Contact Name.com support at:
- Phone: 1-720-249-2374
- Email: support@name.com
- Tell them: "My domain badgertechnologies.us has DNS server configuration issues showing in MX Toolbox"

## What's Working Correctly ✅

- ✅ MX records are properly configured for Google Workspace
- ✅ SPF record is working correctly
- ✅ DKIM record is properly set up
- ✅ Website is accessible and SSL working

## Expected Results After Fixes

Once you fix the DMARC typo and Name.com fixes the server issues:
- Email authentication will be fully compliant
- Improved email deliverability to Outlook/Office 365
- Clean MX Toolbox results
- Professional email setup complete

## Priority Order

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Fix DMARC record typo (you can do this now)
2. **NEXT:** Contact Name.com about server configuration
3. **WAIT:** 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
4. **TEST:** Re-run MX Toolbox to verify fixes

## Notes

- The Google SMTP reverse DNS warnings are normal and not your issue to fix
- Focus on the DMARC typo first - that's the main deliverability issue
- Name.com should fix the server configuration issues for free
