### Healthcare Follow-Up (Amy Bonta)

```
Subject: Re: Specialized IT Support for Nursing Care Facilities

Hi Amy,

I wanted to follow up on my email from last week regarding IT support for Freeburg Care Center.

I understand how busy administrators are, especially with the increasing focus on cybersecurity compliance in healthcare. 

Just a quick thought - with the recent rise in ransomware attacks targeting healthcare facilities, many nursing care centers are finding that a proactive IT security approach actually saves money compared to dealing with incidents after they occur.

Our free IT assessment typically uncovers 3-4 immediate security improvements that can be implemented quickly and cost-effectively.

Would a brief 10-minute call work better for your schedule? I'm happy to work around your availability.

Best regards,

### Property Management Follow-Up (April Anderson)

```
Subject: Re: Cost-Effective IT Solutions for Growing Property Management Firms

Hi April,

Following up on my message about IT solutions for Alter Asset Management.

I know property managers are juggling a lot, and IT often becomes urgent only when something breaks. 

Here's a quick insight: Most property management firms your size are spending 40% more on IT issues than necessary because they're in reactive mode rather than having a proactive plan.

Our clients typically see immediate improvements in:

- Tenant communication system reliability

- Property data security

- Remote access efficiency for property inspections


Would you prefer a quick phone call or could I send you a brief case study of how we helped a similar-sized property management firm in Illinois?

Best,

### Hospitality Follow-Up (Use for Shannon, Laura, Marcos, Brian, Micah, Rick)

```
Subject: Re: IT Solutions for Hospitality - Enhance Guest Experience & Protect Data

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email about IT solutions for [Company Name].

I know the hospitality industry moves fast, and IT concerns often take a backseat to guest experience - until technology issues directly impact that experience.

Quick insight: 73% of guests will switch to a competitor after experiencing Wi-Fi or payment processing issues. Most hospitality businesses don't realize their IT infrastructure is at risk until it's too late.

Our hospitality clients typically see improvements in:

- Guest Wi-Fi reliability and speed

- POS system security and uptime

- Payment processing compliance


Would a 10-minute call work better for your schedule? I can share a quick case study of how we helped a similar hospitality business improve both guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Healthcare Follow-Up #2

```
Subject: Final follow-up - Free cybersecurity assessment for healthcare

Hi Amy,

This will be my final email about IT support for Freeburg Care Center.

I noticed several Illinois healthcare facilities have been in the news lately for data breaches. It made me think about smaller care facilities like yours that might not have dedicated IT security resources.

Here's what I can offer with no strings attached:

- 30-minute free cybersecurity assessment

- Written summary of findings

- Prioritized list of security improvements

- No obligation to work with us afterward


Even if we never work together, you'll have a clear picture of your facility's IT security posture.

If this sounds helpful, just reply with "Yes" and I'll send you a calendar link to choose a time that works for you.

Best regards,
Benjamin Sherman

P.S. If IT isn't a priority right now, I completely understand. Feel free to keep my contact info for future reference.
