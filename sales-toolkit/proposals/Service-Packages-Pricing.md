## HOW TO PRESENT PRICING

### **Don't Say:**
‚ùå "It costs $5,500"  
‚ùå "The price is $5,500"  
‚ùå "We charge $5,500"  

### **Instead Say:**
‚úÖ "The investment is $5,500"  
‚úÖ "Most clients invest between $5,000-$6,000"  
‚úÖ "For $5,500, you get complete peace of mind"  
‚úÖ "Compared to a $200,000 breach, $5,500 is a bargain"  

### **Always Position Value First:**

**WRONG:** "Our security assessment is $5,500. Want to move forward?"

**RIGHT:** "Our comprehensive security assessment will identify every vulnerability in your network, give you a detailed roadmap to fix them, and provide 90 days of support. Most of our clients see this as protecting a $200,000+ investment for just $5,500. Does that sound like something you'd want to move forward with?"

---

## UPSELL OPPORTUNITIES

### **During Initial Sale:**
"Many clients add our **Penetration Testing** to the Professional package for an additional $3,000. This simulates a real hacker attack. Interested?"

### **After Assessment:**
"We found 23 vulnerabilities. **Would you like us to fix them for you?** We can do the implementation for a fixed price of $4,500."

### **After Remediation:**
"Now that your security is solid, would you like **ongoing monitoring** to keep it that way? Just $500/month ensures these issues don't come back."

---

## PRICING SCRIPTS

### **When They Ask "How Much?"**

**You:** "Great question! Our most popular package is the **Professional Security Assessment at $5,500.** This includes a comprehensive network scan, compliance review, detailed remediation plan, and 90 days of support."

**You:** "We also have a **basic package at $2,500** for smaller businesses, and an **enterprise package at $12,500** for larger organizations."

**You:** "Based on what you've told me, I'd recommend the **Professional package.** Does that budget work for you?"

---

### **When They Say "That's Too Expensive"**

**You:** "I totally understand - $5,500 is a significant investment. Can I ask: What's your budget for protecting your business data?"

**[Listen to their answer]**

**You:** "Here's the thing - the average data breach costs $200,000 to recover from. So you're really choosing between spending $5,500 now to prevent it, or potentially $200,000 later to fix it."

**You:** "We do have a **basic package at $2,500** if budget is tight, or we can do **monthly payments of $917 for six months.** Would either of those work better?"

**Now you have clear pricing to present with confidence!** üí™
