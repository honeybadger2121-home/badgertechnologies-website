3. **Accounting** (CPA firms) - Tax software, seasonal needs

4. **Real Estate** (agencies) - Mobile workforce, transaction management

5. **Professional Services** (consulting, engineering) - Knowledge workers need reliable IT

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS FOR SUCCESS



### **1. Sell the Outcome, Not the Service:**

‚ùå Don't say: "We provide managed IT services with monitoring and helpdesk"  
‚úÖ Do say: "We make sure your technology works so you never have to think about IT again"


### **2. Use Their Language:**

‚ùå Don't say: "Network uptime, SLA, redundancy"  
‚úÖ Do say: "Your computers work fast, your team is productive, your business runs smoothly"


### **3. Lead with Business Value:**

‚ùå Don't say: "We'll monitor your servers and patch your systems"  
‚úÖ Do say: "Your team will stop complaining about slow computers and email problems"


### **4. Make the Math Simple:**

**The Comparison:**

- Hiring IT person: $70,000/year

- Emergency IT calls: $24,000/year (estimated)

- **Our managed IT: $18,000/year**


"Same great IT support, half the cost, zero headaches."
