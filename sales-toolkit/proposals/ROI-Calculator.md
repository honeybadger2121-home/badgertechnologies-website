# ROI Calculator & Business Case Tools

## BREACH COST CALCULATOR

### **How to Use This in Sales Conversations:**

**You:** "Let me show you something. Can I ask a few quick questions to calculate what a breach would cost YOUR business specifically?"

---

### **QUESTION 1: How many employees do you have?**

**[CLIENT ANSWERS: _____ employees]**

**Calculate:**
- **Base breach cost per employee:** $180
- **Calculation:** [EMPLOYEES] x $180 = $[TOTAL]

**Example:**
- 25 employees x $180 = **$4,500 base cost**

---

### **QUESTION 2: How much revenue does your business generate per day?**

**[CLIENT ANSWERS: $_____ per day]**

(If they don't know, ask annual revenue and divide by 365)

**Calculate:**
- **Average downtime after breach:** 21 days
- **Calculation:** [DAILY REVENUE] x 21 = $[LOST REVENUE]

**Example:**
- $2,000/day x 21 days = **$42,000 in lost revenue**

---

### **QUESTION 3: Do you store customer data, financial records, or confidential information?**

**[CLIENT ANSWERS: Yes/No]**

**If YES, add:**
- **Legal/Notification Costs:** $15,000
- **Forensic Investigation:** $25,000
- **Credit Monitoring for Customers:** $10,000
- **Total Data Breach Costs:** $50,000

---

### **QUESTION 4: Would your customers find out about a breach?**

**[CLIENT ANSWERS: Yes/Probably/No]**

**If YES, add:**
- **Reputation Damage:** 30% customer loss
- **Calculation:** [ANNUAL REVENUE] x 0.30 = $[REPUTATION COST]

**Example:**
- $500,000 annual revenue x 30% = **$150,000 in lost business**

---

### **TOTAL BREACH COST CALCULATION:**

| Cost Category | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| Base Breach Cost (per employee) | $[A] |
| Lost Revenue (21 days downtime) | $[B] |
| Data Breach Costs (legal, forensics, etc.) | $[C] |
| Reputation Damage (30% customer loss) | $[D] |
| **TOTAL POTENTIAL LOSS** | **$[A+B+C+D]** |

---

**YOUR INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION:** $5,500

**POTENTIAL LOSS WITHOUT PROTECTION:** $[TOTAL]

**ROI:** $[TOTAL] ÷ $5,500 = **[X]x return on investment**

---

**Example Calculation:**

| Cost Category | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| Base Breach Cost (25 employees x $180) | $4,500 |
| Lost Revenue ($2,000/day x 21 days) | $42,000 |
| Data Breach Costs | $50,000 |
| Reputation Damage ($500K x 30%) | $150,000 |
| **TOTAL POTENTIAL LOSS** | **$246,500** |

**Your Investment:** $5,500  
**Potential Loss Prevented:** $246,500  
**ROI:** 44.8x return  

**Translation:** For every $1 you invest, you're protecting $45!

## SIMPLIFIED ROI CALCULATOR (FOR QUICK CONVERSATIONS)

### **The 5-Minute Downtime Test**

**You:** "Quick question - what does your business make per hour?"

**[CLIENT ANSWERS: $_____ per hour]**

**You:** "Okay, so if your systems went down for one week (168 hours), you'd lose..."

**Calculation:** [HOURLY REVENUE] x 168 hours = $[LOSS]

**Example:**
- $200/hour x 168 hours = **$33,600 lost in one week**

**You:** "And that's JUST lost revenue - doesn't include the cost to fix the breach, legal fees, or reputation damage."

**You:** "So you can either invest $5,500 now to prevent this, or risk losing $30,000+ later. Which makes more sense?"

## INSURANCE COST COMPARISON

### **Cyber Insurance vs. Security Assessment**

**Typical Cyber Insurance:**

- **Coverage:** $1 million (typical)
- **Deductible:** $10,000 - $50,000

- **Coverage:** Prevents breach from happening
- **Deductible:** $0
- **What it does:** PREVENTS you from getting hacked

**Sales Script:**
"Cyber insurance is like car insurance - it pays after the accident. Our assessment is like defensive driving school - it prevents the accident. Which would you rather have?"

**Even Better:**
"Many insurance companies offer 20-30% discounts if you have a recent security assessment. Our $5,500 service could save you $1,500/year on insurance. It pays for itself in 3-4 years!"

## COMPETITOR COMPARISON

### **Us vs. Other Options**

| Solution | Cost | What You Get | Limitations |
|----------|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Do Nothing** | $0 | Nothing | Guaranteed breach eventually |
| **Basic IT Company** | $1,500 | Basic scan | No security expertise |
| **Enterprise Security Firm** | $15,000+ | Comprehensive | Overpriced for small business |
| **DIY Tools** | $500 | Scanning software | No interpretation or guidance |
| **BADGER TECHNOLOGIES** | **$5,500** | **Comprehensive assessment + Roadmap + Support** | **Perfect for small business** |

**Sales Script:**
"You could try to do this yourself with free tools, but would you understand the results? You could hire a big enterprise firm, but they'll charge $15,000+. We're the sweet spot - expert-level assessment at a small business price."

## TIME VALUE CALCULATOR

### **Cost of Delay**

**How much does it cost to wait?**

**Question:** "When are you thinking about doing this assessment?"

**[CLIENT ANSWERS: "In 6 months" or "Next quarter" or "Maybe next year"]**

**Calculate:**

| Delay Period | Breach Probability | Expected Cost |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Next week | 1% | $2,500 |
| 1 month | 4% | $10,000 |
| 3 months | 12% | $30,000 |
| 6 months | 25% | $62,500 |
| 1 year | 43% | $107,500 |

**Sales Script:**
"I understand wanting to wait, but here's the reality: Every month you wait, your risk of getting hacked increases. If you wait 6 months, there's a 25% chance you'll be breached before we even do the assessment. At that point, you're paying $200,000+ to fix it instead of $5,500 to prevent it. Is saving a few months really worth risking $200,000?"

## THE "COFFEE SHOP" COMPARISON

### **Making $5,500 Feel Small**

**Sales Script:**

**You:** "I know $5,500 seems like a lot. Let me put it in perspective..."

**Daily Cost Over 3 Years:**
- $5,500 ÷ 1,095 days = **$5.02 per day**

**You:** "You're protecting your entire business for about the cost of a latte. If Starbucks offered 'Business Protection Insurance' for $5 a day, you'd buy it in a heartbeat, right?"

**OR**

**Monthly Cost Over 12 Months:**
- $5,500 ÷ 12 = **$458 per month**

**You:** "That's less than what you probably pay for your business internet, phone, or office supplies. But it protects everything those other services run on."
