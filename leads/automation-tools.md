Dear Amy,

I'm Benjamin Sherman from Badger Technologies, and I'm reaching out because nursing care facilities like Freeburg Care Center have unique IT security and compliance requirements.

As Administrator, you're responsible for protecting sensitive resident information while ensuring your care team has reliable access to the technology they need to provide excellent patient care.

Smaller care facilities often struggle with:

• Maintaining reliable systems for electronic health records

✓ Affordable HIPAA compliance programs
✓ Cybersecurity protection specifically for healthcare data
✓ Reliable support for electronic health record systems
✓ Local Illinois service with quick response times
✓ Scalable solutions that grow with your facility

Given Freeburg Care Center's size, we can provide personalized attention and develop an IT strategy that fits your specific needs and budget.

I'd be happy to offer you a free IT assessment to review your current setup and identify opportunities to enhance security while controlling costs.

Could we schedule a brief 15-minute conversation to discuss how we can support Freeburg Care Center's technology needs?

Best regards,
