## Email 1: The "No IT Person" Problem

**Subject:** Who handles IT at [COMPANY NAME]?

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Quick question: **Who's responsible for IT at [COMPANY NAME]?**

If your answer is:
- "Me, I guess?" (but IT isn't your job)
- "Our office manager handles it" (but they're not trained in IT)
- "We call someone when things break" (reactive, expensive)
- "It's kind of everyone's problem" (chaos)

**You're not alone.** Most small businesses face the same challenge.

**The problem:**
You need reliable IT support, but can't justify a $70K/year full-time IT person.

**The solution:**
You get a complete IT department for a fraction of the cost.

**What Badger Technologies does:**
We become your IT department:
- **Unlimited helpdesk support** - Your team emails or calls us, we fix it
- **Proactive monitoring** - We catch problems before they disrupt your business
- **Regular maintenance** - Updates, patches, optimization - all handled
- **Strategic planning** - We help you make smart technology decisions

**Your monthly investment:** Starting at $799/month

**That's less than:**
- A part-time employee
- Your current break-fix IT costs (probably)
- The cost of downtime from IT problems

**Next step:**
I'd love to offer you a **free IT assessment** where I'll:
- Review your current setup
- Show you where you're losing time and money
- Explain exactly how managed IT would work for [COMPANY NAME]
- Give you a custom quote

**Reply "INTERESTED"** and I'll send you some times this week.

## Email 2: Technology Frustration Focus

**Subject:** Is technology slowing down your business?

---

[FIRST NAME],

Let me guess what happened this week at [COMPANY NAME]:

‚ùå Someone's computer was running slow  
‚ùå The printer stopped working (again)  
‚ùå Email had issues  
‚ùå Someone couldn't access a file they needed  
‚ùå You spent time troubleshooting instead of running your business

Sound familiar?

**Here's the thing:**
These "small" IT problems add up fast:
- 5-10 hours/week of staff time wasted = $15,000-$30,000/year
- Emergency IT calls at $150/hour = $2,000-$5,000/year  
- Lost productivity from downtime = $5,000-$15,000/year
- Stress and frustration = Priceless

**What if IT just... worked?**

That's what we do. Badger Technologies becomes your IT department:

‚úÖ **Problems get fixed fast** - Email/call us, we handle it remotely  
‚úÖ **Prevention, not reaction** - We monitor and maintain everything  
‚úÖ **One monthly fee** - No surprise bills  
‚úÖ **Strategic guidance** - Make smart technology decisions  
‚úÖ **Peace of mind** - Focus on your business, not IT

**Monthly investment:** Starting at $799/month

**That's less than:**
- One emergency IT call per week
- The hidden cost of doing nothing
- A part-time employee who only knows "basic" IT

**My offer:**
Let me do a **free IT assessment** - I'll show you:
- Where your current setup is costing you money
- How we'd keep your technology running smoothly  
- Exactly what you'd pay (and save)

**Reply "YES"** and I'll send some available times.

## Email 3: Growth-Focused Message

**Subject:** Technology holding back your growth?

---

[FIRST NAME],

Most small businesses hit a growth wall around 15-20 employees.

**Why?** Their technology can't scale with them.

**Sound familiar?**
- Your systems were set up 5+ years ago
- You're outgrowing what "worked" for a small team
- Adding new employees means new IT headaches
- You're not sure what technology you actually need
- You're afraid to change anything (might break it all)

**The result:** Technology becomes a roadblock instead of an asset.

**Here's what growing businesses need:**
‚úÖ **Scalable infrastructure** - Systems that grow with you  
‚úÖ **Strategic planning** - Know what to invest in (and when)  
‚úÖ **Reliable support** - Technology that doesn't slow you down  
‚úÖ **Security & compliance** - Protected as you get more visible  
‚úÖ **Predictable costs** - Budget for growth, not surprises

**This is what we specialize in.**

Badger Technologies helps growing businesses (10-50 employees) build IT infrastructure that supports expansion, not prevents it.

**Our managed IT services include:**
- Complete helpdesk and technical support
- Strategic technology planning and roadmapping
- Cloud infrastructure and scalability

- Proactive monitoring and maintenance
- Budget-friendly monthly pricing

**Monthly investment:** $799 - $1,499/month (based on company size)

**What clients tell us:**
- "We added 10 employees without adding IT stress"
- "I finally have a clear technology roadmap"
- "IT went from our biggest problem to not a problem at all"

**Next step:**
Let me do a **free growth technology assessment**:
- Review your current setup
- Identify bottlenecks limiting your growth
- Show you what scalable IT looks like
- Provide a custom plan and pricing

**Are you available for a 15-minute call this week?**

## Email 4: Cost of Downtime

**Subject:** [COMPANY NAME] - Calculate your downtime cost

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

**Quick math exercise:**

How much revenue does [COMPANY NAME] generate per hour?

Now multiply that by 72 hours (the average time a small business is down after a major IT failure).

**That's your downtime cost.**

For most businesses, it's **$50,000-$500,000** in lost revenue, plus:
- Customer trust damage
- Employee productivity loss
- Emergency IT costs
- Potential legal liability

**The solution:** Proactive IT security and disaster recovery.

**Here's what I propose:**
Let me spend 5 days analyzing your IT infrastructure and show you:
1. Where you're vulnerable
2. What it would cost if systems failed
3. How to prevent expensive downtime
4. Exact ROI of fixing vs. risk of not fixing

**Investment:** $3,500  
**Potential savings:** $50,000-$500,000+

**Next step:**
15-minute call to see if this makes sense for [COMPANY NAME].

When's better - **Tuesday 2pm or Wednesday 10am**?
