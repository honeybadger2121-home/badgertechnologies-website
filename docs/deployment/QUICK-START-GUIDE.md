## üìã OBJECTION HANDLING CHEAT SHEET

### **"We already have IT support"**
**You:** "That's great! Are they proactive or reactive? When was your last strategic technology planning session?"

**Angle:** Position yourself as BETTER support, not just cheaper

---

### **"That's too expensive"**
**You:** "I understand. What are you spending now on IT? Let's add up emergency calls, staff time troubleshooting, and downtime costs."

**Show the math:**
- Emergency IT: $150/hr √ó 15 calls/year = $2,250
- Staff time wasted: 5hrs/week √ó $25/hr √ó 52 weeks = $6,500
- Downtime costs: 1 day/year √ó $2,000 = $2,000
- **Total: $10,750/year** (vs. our $9,588/year with better service)

---

### **"We're too small for managed IT"**
**You:** "Actually, small businesses need us MORE because you don't have an IT department. Our Essential package at $799/month is designed specifically for businesses your size."

**Comparison:** $799/month vs. $3,500-$5,000/year in emergency calls

---

### **"We'll think about it"**
**You:** "Of course! What specific concerns do you need to think through? Maybe I can provide more information."

**Follow-up:** "How about I send you a proposal with exact pricing and we can review it together? No pressure."

---

### **"Can we start with just a one-time project?"**
**You:** "Absolutely! We can do a network setup or security assessment. But here's the thing - most clients wish they'd started with managed services because we prevent the problems before they happen."

**Offer:** "What if we start with a 3-month trial of managed IT? If you're not happy, you can cancel anytime."
