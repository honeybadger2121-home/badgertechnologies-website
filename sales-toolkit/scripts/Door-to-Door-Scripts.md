## SCRIPT 1: THE OPENER (Receptionist/Gatekeeper)

**[Walk in confidently, smile, make eye contact]**

**You:** "Hi! I'm Benjamin with Badger Technologies. Is [OWNER/OFFICE MANAGER] available for a quick 2-minute conversation?"

**Receptionist:** "What is this regarding?"

**You:** "We provide IT support for small businesses here in [CITY/AREA]. I just wanted to introduce myself since we're local and see if they're happy with their current IT situation."

**[Alternative approach - more direct]**

**You:** "We help businesses eliminate their IT headaches - you know, slow computers, network problems, that sort of thing. Takes 2 minutes to see if we can help."

---

### **If they say YES:**

**Receptionist:** "Let me check. One moment."

**You:** "Thank you!"

**[Wait patiently, stand - shows you're not taking up time]**

---

### **If they say NO/BUSY:**

**Receptionist:** "He's with a client / in a meeting / not available."

**You:** "No problem! What's the best time to catch him/her? I can swing back by."

**Receptionist:** "Try calling to set an appointment."

**You:** "Perfect! Can I leave my card and a quick overview? Honestly, most offices we talk to are spending way more on emergency IT calls than they would on our monthly support."

**[Hand business card + one-pager]**

**You:** "I'll shoot over an email this afternoon. What's the best address to reach [DECISION MAKER]?"

**[Get contact info, thank them warmly, leave]**

---

## SCRIPT 2: MEETING THE DECISION MAKER

**[Owner/Manager comes out to meet you]**

**You:** "Hi! Benjamin Sherman. Thanks for seeing me - I know you're busy, so I'll be quick."

**[Shake hands firmly, smile, maintain eye contact]**

**You:** "I run Badger Technologies here in [CITY]. We provide complete IT support for small businesses - kind of like having an IT department without the full-time cost."

**[Pause - gauge their interest]**

**You:** "Quick question: **Who handles IT stuff for you now?**"

**[Let them answer, then respond based on their situation]**

---

### **Their Response Option 1: "We have someone who handles it"**

**You:** "Oh great! Is that an employee, or do you have an IT company?"

**If employee:**
**You:** "Gotcha. So what happens when that person is out sick, or on vacation? Or if something breaks after hours?"

**If outsourced/break-fix:**
**You:** "Nice. And are they proactive - like monitoring your systems, or more reactive - you call them when things break?"

**Them:** "Mostly when things break..."

**You:** "That's pretty common. Here's the thing - **reactive IT ends up costing way more than proactive support**."

**You:** "Emergency calls at $150/hour, staff time wasted troubleshooting, downtime costing you productivity... it adds up fast. Most businesses your size spend $2,000-$5,000/year on 'break-fix' without realizing it."

**You:** "Our managed IT service is **$799 to $1,499 per month** - one flat fee, unlimited support, and we prevent problems before they start."

**You:** "Want me to do a free assessment? I can show you exactly what you're spending now vs. what our service would cost. Usually saves money AND reduces headaches."

---

### **Their Response Option 2: "What exactly do you do?"**

**You:** "Great question! We basically become your IT department. Here's what that means:"

**You:** "✅ **Unlimited helpdesk** - Your staff emails or calls us when they have issues, we fix it  
✅ **Proactive monitoring** - We watch your systems 24/7 and fix problems before they cause downtime  
✅ **Regular maintenance** - Updates, patches, optimization - all handled  
✅ **Strategic planning** - We help you make smart technology decisions  
✅ **One monthly fee** - No surprise bills, no hourly charges"

**You:** "Think of it like having an IT person on staff, but for a fraction of the cost."

**You:** "Most businesses your size pay **$799 to $1,499 per month**. That's less than a part-time employee, and you get a whole team."

**You:** "When's a good time for me to come back and do a free IT assessment?"

---

### **Their Response Option 3: "How much does it cost?"**

**You:** "Depends on how many people you have and what you need, but most businesses your size are between **$799 and $1,499 per month**."

**[Gauge their reaction]**

**You:** "I know that might seem like a lot, but let me put it in perspective:"

**You:** "Hiring a full-time IT person? $70,000/year plus benefits. A part-timer? Still $35,000-$40,000/year."

**You:** "Emergency IT calls? If you're calling someone even once a month at $150/hour, that's already $1,800+ per year, and you're still waiting days for them to show up."

**You:** "With us, it's **$800-$1,500/month for UNLIMITED support** - email, phone, remote, even on-site visits. And we're preventing problems, not just reacting to them."

**You:** "Would it help if I did a free assessment? I can show you exactly what you'd get and what it would cost for your specific situation."

---

### **Their Response Option 4: "We're not interested"**

**You:** "No worries at all! Can I ask - is it because you're totally happy with your current setup, or just not thinking about IT right now?"

**Them:** "We're fine / Not a priority / Too expensive / Happy with current"

**You:** "Totally understand. **One quick question though:** When was the last time you had an IT problem that wasted time or cost you money?"

**[Let them think]**

**You:** "Most business owners don't realize how much time and money IT problems are costing until they add it up. Staff troubleshooting, downtime, emergency calls... it sneaks up on you."

**You:** "Tell you what - here's my card. If you ever get frustrated with IT stuff, or just want a second opinion on what you're spending, give me a call. I'll do a free assessment, no strings attached."

**[Hand card, smile genuinely, leave on good terms]**

**You:** "Nice meeting you! Have a great day."

## SCRIPT 3: THE ELEVATOR PITCH (30 Seconds)

**Use this when:** Someone asks "What do you do?" or you have limited time.

**Version 1 (Problem-focused):**

**You:** "I run Badger Technologies - we eliminate IT headaches for small businesses."

"You know how frustrating it is when computers are slow, printers don't work, network goes down, and you don't have anyone to call?"

"**We fix that.** We become your IT department - unlimited support, proactive monitoring, one monthly fee."

"Most businesses find they actually save money compared to calling someone every time something breaks."

**[Pause]**

**You:** "Do you ever deal with frustrating IT problems?"

---

**Version 2 (Value-focused):**

**You:** "We provide complete IT support for small businesses - everything from helpdesk to strategy."

"Think of it like having an IT person on staff, but for $800-$1,500/month instead of $70,000/year."

"Your team gets help when they need it, your technology actually works, and you get predictable costs. That's it."

**[Pause]**

**You:** "Is your IT situation where you want it to be?"

**You:** "We can even break it into monthly payments. **Would $300/month work better** than $3,500 upfront?"

---

### **Objection: "We're too small to be targeted"**

**You:** "That's what most small businesses think - and that's exactly why hackers target them!"

**You:** "Big companies have huge security budgets. **Small businesses are easier targets** because they assume they're safe."

**You:** "43% of cyber attacks target small businesses. You're actually MORE at risk than larger companies."

**You:** "For $3,500, wouldn't you like to know for sure that you're protected?"

---

### **Objection: "I need to think about it"**

**You:** "Absolutely! This is an important decision. Can I ask what specifically you need to think about?"

**[Listen to their concern, address it]**

**You:** "Tell you what - let me email you some info about what we do and a couple case studies. No pressure, just so you can review it when you have time."

**You:** "What's the best email?"

**[Get email, follow up within 24 hours]**

---

### **Objection: "Just email me information"**

**You:** "Happy to! Before I send that over, can I ask two quick questions so I send you the right info?"

1. **"What's your biggest IT concern right now?"** (backup? compliance? security?)
2. **"Have you ever had a security incident or close call?"** (virus, ransomware attempt, breach)

**[Based on answers, customize your follow-up email]**

**You:** "Perfect! I'll send that over by end of day. **Can I follow up with you on Thursday** to see if you have any questions?"

---

## SCRIPT 5: THE CLOSE

### **Trial Close:**

**You:** "Based on what you've told me, I think a security assessment would be perfect for you. **Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?"**

---

### **Hard Close:**

**You:** "Here's what I'd like to do: Let me come back on **[DAY]** at **[TIME]** and do a quick 30-minute site survey. I'll see your setup and give you a ballpark quote. Sound good?"

---

### **Assumptive Close:**

**You:** "Great! I'm going to send you a proposal this afternoon. **Are you generally the final decision maker, or does someone else need to sign off?"**

---

### **Alternative Close:**

**You:** "I have openings this week on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning. **Which works better for you?"**

---

## SCRIPT 6: LEAVING ON GOOD TERMS

### **If they're not interested:**

**You:** "No problem at all! I appreciate your time. Here's my card - when things change or if you ever have questions about IT security, feel free to reach out."

**[Shake hands, smile]**

**You:** "By the way, if you know anyone who might need security help - other business owners, colleagues - I'd really appreciate the referral. We do great work and take care of people."

**[Leave]**

---

### **If they want to think about it:**

**You:** "Sounds good! I'll email you that info today. **Can I give you a call on Friday** to answer any questions?"

**Them:** "Sure" or "I'll call you if interested"

**You:** "Perfect! I'll send the email now and check in Friday. Thanks for your time!"

**[Leave]**

---
