## SCRIPT 1: BYPASSING THE GATEKEEPER

### **When receptionist answers:**

**Receptionist:** "ABC Company, how can I help you?"

**You:** "Hi! This is Benjamin Sherman, can you connect me with [OWNER NAME]?"

**[Say it confidently, like you know them]**

---

### **If they ask what it's regarding:**

**Receptionist:** "What is this regarding?"

**You (Option 1 - Direct):** "It's about their IT support needs. Can you put me through?"

**You (Option 2 - Vague):** "I'm following up on some information I sent over. Is he/she available?"

**You (Option 3 - Peer-level):** "I'm with Badger Technologies, just need to speak with him/her briefly about their IT infrastructure."

---

### **If they say "He's not available":**

**You:** "No problem! What's the best time to reach him/her?"

**Receptionist:** "You can try back after 2pm."

**You:** "Perfect! What's his/her direct line so I can reach him/her directly?"

**[If they won't give it:]**

**You:** "Okay, I'll call back then. What's his/her email? I'll send over some info beforehand."

**[Get the email, send a warm-up email, call back at suggested time]**

---

## SCRIPT 2: THE OPENING (When Decision Maker Answers)

**Owner:** "Hello?"

**You:** "Hi [FIRST NAME], this is Benjamin Sherman with Badger Technologies. How are you today?"

**[Wait for response - build quick rapport]**

**You:** "Great! I'll be brief - I know you're busy. **The reason I'm calling** is we help businesses in [CITY/INDUSTRY] solve their IT problems and keep their technology running smoothly."

**You:** "I'm calling today because **most small businesses struggle with slow computers, network issues, and unreliable IT support** - and I wanted to see if that's something you're dealing with."

**You:** "**Are you currently happy with your IT support,** or are there things that could be working better?"

**[STOP TALKING - Let them answer]**

---

## SCRIPT 3: QUALIFYING QUESTIONS

### **If they express IT frustrations:**

**You:** "I hear that a lot. Most businesses are frustrated with slow response times and reactive IT support that only fixes problems after they happen."

**Them:** "Exactly! Our computer guy takes forever to get back to us..."

**You:** "Here's the thing - **your business can't afford to wait when technology breaks down.** Every minute of downtime costs you money and productivity."

**You:** "**Can I ask you a few quick questions** to see if our managed IT services would be a good fit?"

---

### **The Qualifying Questions:**

**Question 1:** "How many employees do you have?" [Establishes company size for pricing]

**Question 2:** "What happens when your computers or network go down? How long does it usually take to get fixed?" [Identifies pain points]

**Question 3:** "Are you currently paying per incident, or do you have monthly IT support?" [Understands current model]

**Question 4:** "How much are you spending on IT support per month?" [Budget qualification]

**Question 5:** "What's your biggest IT frustration right now?" [Identifies specific problems to solve]

---

## SCRIPT 4: THE PITCH (Based on Their Answers)

### **If they have IT problems:**

**You:** "Based on what you're telling me, it sounds like managed IT support would solve a lot of headaches for [COMPANY]."

**You:** "Here's what we do: **We become your complete IT department.** Help desk support, network monitoring, data backups, security - everything you need to keep your business running smoothly."

**You:** "Most businesses your size invest between **$149 and $299 per month** depending on how many users you have and what level of support you need."

**You:** "But here's the thing - **that monthly investment prevents expensive downtime** and gives you predictable IT costs. No more surprise repair bills."

**You:** "Does that sound like something you'd want to explore?"

---

### **If they're hesitant about monthly costs:**

**You:** "I totally understand budget concerns. Let me ask you this:"

**You:** "**How much did you spend on IT last year** - all the emergency calls, repairs, new equipment, everything?"

**[Let them calculate in their head]**

**You:** "I bet it was more than $149 a month, right? **With managed IT support, you get 24/7 monitoring, unlimited help desk support, and predictable monthly costs.**"

**You:** "Plus, **we prevent problems before they happen,** so you're not constantly dealing with fires."

---

## SCRIPT 5: OBJECTION HANDLING

### **Objection: "We already have an IT company"**

**You:** "That's great! Are they providing proactive monitoring and 24/7 support, or do you call them when something breaks?"

**Them:** "We call when something breaks..."

**You:** "Here's the difference - **reactive IT support waits for problems to happen. Managed IT support prevents them.**"

**You:** "Think about it - would you rather fix your car after it breaks down on the highway, or have regular maintenance to prevent breakdowns?"

**You:** "Most of our clients were getting frustrated with their old 'break-fix' IT company because they were always dealing with emergencies."

**You:** "**Can I send you some info** about what proactive IT support looks like? What's the best email?"

---

### **Objection: "We can't afford it right now"**

**You:** "I understand. Can I ask - **what are you currently spending on IT per month?**"

**[If they say "nothing" or very little:]**

**You:** "So you're probably calling someone when things break and paying emergency rates, right? That can be $150-200 per hour."

**You:** "Our **Essential Support is $149/month** - that's less than one emergency service call, but you get unlimited support and monitoring."

**[If they have a current IT budget:]**

**You:** "What if we could **give you better service for the same price** you're paying now, plus prevent most of those emergency calls?"

---

### **Objection: "I need to think about it"**

**You:** "Absolutely, this is an important decision. **Can I ask what specifically you need to think about?"**

**[Listen to their concern]**

**You:** "That makes sense. Here's what I suggest: **Let me send you a proposal and a couple case studies** from businesses like yours that we've helped."

**You:** "**Can I schedule a 15-minute follow-up call for Thursday** to answer any questions after you've had a chance to review it?"

**[Pin them down to a specific time]**

---

### **Objection: "Just send me information"**

**You:** "Happy to! Before I do, **can I ask two quick questions** so I send the right info?"

**Question 1:** "What's your biggest IT concern right now - backups, compliance, security, or something else?"

**Question 2:** "Have you ever had a security incident or close call?"

**[Based on their answers:]**

**You:** "Perfect. I'll customize the proposal based on that and send it over by end of day."

**You:** "**I'll give you a call on Friday afternoon** to make sure you received it and answer any questions. Does 2pm work for you?"

**[Lock in the callback!]**

---

## SCRIPT 6: SETTING THE APPOINTMENT

### **Soft Close:**

**You:** "Based on what you've told me, I think we can really help [COMPANY]. **Would you be open to a quick 30-minute consultation** where I can learn more about your setup and give you a ballpark quote?"

---

### **Direct Close:**

**You:** "Here's what I'd like to do: **Let's schedule a 30-minute meeting** - I'll come to your office, take a quick look at your setup, and give you a customized proposal. No charge, no obligation."

**You:** "**I have Tuesday at 10am or Thursday at 2pm available. Which works better for you?"**

**[Give them two options - makes it easier to say yes]**

---

### **Alternative Close:**

**You:** "I'm booking consultations for next week. **Do mornings or afternoons work better for you?"**

**[Once they pick:]**

**You:** "Great! I have **Tuesday at 10am or Wednesday at 3pm.** Which one should I put you down for?"

---

## SCRIPT 7: VOICEMAIL SCRIPT

**[Keep it under 30 seconds!]**

**You:** "Hi [FIRST NAME], this is Benjamin Sherman with Badger Technologies. I'm calling about IT security for [COMPANY NAME]."

**You:** "We help businesses like yours prevent ransomware attacks and data breaches. **Most businesses don't realize they're at risk until it's too late."**

**You:** "I'd love to chat for 5 minutes about protecting your business. My number is [YOUR NUMBER] - that's [REPEAT NUMBER SLOWLY]."

**You:** "I'll also follow up with an email. Talk soon!"

**[Immediately send a follow-up email referencing the voicemail]**

---

## SCRIPT 8: FOLLOW-UP CALL (After Sending Email)

**You:** "Hi [FIRST NAME], Benjamin Sherman calling. I sent you an email yesterday about IT security for [COMPANY]."

**You:** "**Did you have a chance to look at it?"**

**[If YES:]**

**You:** "Great! **Do you have any questions?**"

**[Address questions, then move to close]**

**[If NO:]**

**You:** "No worries - I know your inbox is probably slammed. **Let me give you the 30-second version** over the phone right now..."

**[Give elevator pitch, then:]**

**You:** "Does that sound like something you'd want to explore?"

---

## SCRIPT 9: REFERRAL REQUEST

**[After good conversation, even if they don't buy:]**

**You:** "I really appreciate your time today, [FIRST NAME]. **Even if we don't work together right now, I'd love to help other businesses in [INDUSTRY/CITY]."**

**You:** "**Do you know anyone** - colleagues, business partners, friends - who might benefit from a security assessment?"

**[If they give you a name:]**

**You:** "Thank you! Can I mention that you referred me when I reach out?"

**[Get referral contact info, follow up immediately]**
