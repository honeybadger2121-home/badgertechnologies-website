###**Email 3 - Break-Up** (Day 8)


**Subject:** Should I close your file?

---

[FIRST NAME],

I've reached out a couple times about IT security for [COMPANY NAME], but haven't heard back.

**I'm going to assume you're either:**

1. Not interested (totally fine!)

2. Swamped and this isn't a priority right now

3. My emails are going to spam (oops!)


If it's #2, just reply "LATER" and tell me when would be better. I'll follow up then.


If it's #1 or #3, reply "REMOVE" and I won't bug you again.


Either way, best of luck with [COMPANY NAME]!

### **Email 3 - Different Angle** (Day 7)


**Subject:** [FIRST NAME], one question...

---

[FIRST NAME],

Quick question that might keep you up at night:

**If your business got hit with ransomware tomorrow, how long would you be offline?**

Hours? Days? Weeks?

Every hour of downtime costs [COMPANY NAME] approximately $[CALCULATE: AVG REVENUE PER HOUR].

I help businesses eliminate this risk.

**5-minute conversation** - that's all I'm asking. I promise it will be worth your time.

Call me: [YOUR PHONE]  
Or reply with your best time and I'll call you.

### **Email 4 - Value Content** (Day 11)


**Subject:** [FIRST NAME] - 5 signs you need an IT security assessment

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Still haven't heard from you, so I wanted to send over something useful.

**5 Signs You Need an IT Security Assessment:**


1. **You don't know** - If you can't answer "Are we secure?" with 100% confidence

2. **Last assessment was 12+ months ago** - Threats evolve fast

3. **Employee turnover** - Former employees still have access?

4. **New compliance requirements** - Regulations are getting stricter  

5. **Growth** - More employees/locations = more vulnerability


**How many apply to [COMPANY NAME]?**

If it's more than 2, we should talk.

Free consultation: [CALENDAR LINK] or reply to this email.

2. Use Boomerang for scheduled sending

3. Set reminders to follow up

4. Use labels to track sequence stage


**If using CRM:**

1. Set up automated sequences

2. Track open/click rates

3. Trigger follow-ups based on behavior

4. Score leads based on engagement


**Low-Tech Option:**

1. Calendar reminders for each follow-up

2. Spreadsheet to track who's where

3. Folders in email for each sequence stage

4. Checklist for daily follow-up tasks

**Remember:** Persistence wins! Most sales happen after 5-7 touchpoints. Don't give up after one email!
