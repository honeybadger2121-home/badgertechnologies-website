## 📈 CONVERSION FUNNEL

**Expected conversion rates:**

```
100 contacts made
  ↓ (30% answer/respond)
30 conversations
  ↓ (25% show interest)
8 interested prospects
  ↓ (50% agree to meeting)
4 meetings/consultations
  ↓ (75% want proposal)
3 proposals sent
  ↓ (50% close rate)
1-2 CLIENTS SIGNED! 🎉
```

**Translation:** Make 100 contacts = 1-2 clients

**So to get 4-6 clients/month, you need 400-600 contacts/month**

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### **Q: Which template should I use first?**
**A:** Start with healthcare or small business cold emails. Healthcare has higher budget, small business has more volume.

### **Q: How many follow-ups before giving up?**
**A:** 5-7 follow-ups. Most sales happen on the 5th+ touchpoint!

### **Q: What if they say "We already have IT support"?**
**A:** "Great! IT support ≠ IT security. We specialize in security. We can work alongside your current IT company."

### **Q: What if they say it's too expensive?**
**A:** Use ROI calculator. "Would you rather spend $5,500 now or $200,000+ after a breach?"

### **Q: Should I offer discounts?**
**A:** Only strategically (first 3 clients, referral discounts, prepay discounts). Don't devalue your service.

### **Q: How do I handle rejection?**
**A:** Expect 80%+ to say no. It's normal! Every "no" gets you closer to "yes."
