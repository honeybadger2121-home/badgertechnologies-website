Let me walk you through how we'll implement this for your specific environment..."

Our monitoring and rapid response service would reduce that risk by 95%, 
saving you $[Y] annually. The investment of $[service cost] per month provides 
an ROI of [calculated percentage] - when would you like to get started?"

```
"Cybersecurity threats are increasing daily, and we're seeing businesses
