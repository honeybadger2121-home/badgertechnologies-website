## TRACKING BEST PRACTICES



### **DO:**

✅ Update immediately after every interaction  
✅ Be specific in notes ("Budget is $5K" not "Interested")  
✅ Set follow-up dates for EVERYTHING  
✅ Review daily (5 minutes morning, 5 minutes evening)  
✅ Track what's working (source tracking!)  


### **DON'T:**

❌ Let it get outdated (garbage in = garbage out)  
❌ Forget to log activities  
❌ Skip follow-ups  
❌ Use vague notes ("Had good conversation")  
❌ Overcomplicate it with too many fields

## SALES FORECAST FORMULA


**How to predict your monthly revenue:**

**Formula:**
```
Monthly Revenue = (Leads × Conversion %) × Average Deal Size
```

**Example:**

- 100 leads per month

- 10% conversion rate

- $5,500 average deal size


**Calculation:**
```
(100 × 0.10) × $5,500 = 10 sales × $5,500 = $55,000/month
```

**Use your actual metrics:**

1. Count how many leads you generate per month

2. Calculate your conversion rate (sales ÷ total leads)

3. Calculate average deal size (total revenue ÷ number of sales)

4. Plug into formula above


**This tells you exactly how many leads you need to hit your revenue goals!**

---


## GOAL SETTING



### **Reverse Engineer Your Goals:**


**Want to make $10,000/month?**


- Average deal: $5,500

- Needed sales: $10,000 ÷ $5,500 = **2 sales/month**

- Conversion rate: 10%

- Needed leads: 2 ÷ 0.10 = **20 leads/month**

- 20 leads ÷ 4 weeks = **5 new leads per week**

- 5 leads per week ÷ 5 days = **1 new lead per day**


**To hit $10K/month, you need:**

- ✅ 1 new qualified lead per day

- ✅ 20 total leads per month

- ✅ 2 closed deals per month


**Now you know exactly what to do every day!**
