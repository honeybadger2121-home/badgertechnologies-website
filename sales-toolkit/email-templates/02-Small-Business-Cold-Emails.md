## Email 1: General Small Business Outreach

**Subject:** [COMPANY NAME] - Is your business data protected?

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I help small businesses in [CITY] protect their data and avoid costly IT disasters.

**Quick question:** If your server crashed right now, how long would it take to get back online?

If the answer is "I don't know" or "more than 4 hours," we should talk.

**Here's what I do:**
I run comprehensive IT security assessments that identify vulnerabilities BEFORE they become expensive problems.

**Recent client example:**
Last week, I helped a [INDUSTRY] company discover:
- Critical security holes that could have led to ransomware
- No backup system (they were one hard drive failure away from losing everything)
- 15 outdated software programs with known exploits

**Cost to fix:** $6,500  
**Cost if ransomware hit first:** $50,000-$250,000+

**My offer for [COMPANY NAME]:**
Free 30-minute IT security consultation where I'll:
‚úì Identify your 3 biggest risks  
‚úì Show you what a breach would actually cost  
‚úì Give you actionable recommendations

No charge, no obligation. Just valuable insights.

**Reply "INTERESTED"** and I'll send you some times this week.

## Email 2: Ransomware Focus

**Subject:** Don't wait for ransomware to strike

---

[FIRST NAME],

Ransomware attacks on small businesses are up **300%** this year.

The average cost? **$1.85 million** (including downtime, recovery, and lost business).

**Scary question:** Could [COMPANY NAME] survive being locked out of your systems for 2 weeks?

**Most businesses can't.**

**Here's the reality:**
- 60% of small businesses close within 6 months of a major cyber attack
- Hackers specifically target small businesses (easier targets)
- Paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you'll get your data back

**What we do:**
At Badger Technologies, I help small businesses **prevent** ransomware before it happens.

**Our 5-day security assessment identifies:**
1. Unpatched vulnerabilities hackers exploit
2. Weak points in your network security
3. Missing or inadequate backup systems
4. Risky employee behavior that opens doors to attacks
5. Compliance gaps that create legal liability

**Investment:** $3,500-$7,500 (vs. $1.85M average ransomware cost)

**Free offer:**
Let me run a quick security scan of your external-facing systems. I'll show you exactly how vulnerable you are to attack.

**No cost. No obligation. Just facts.**

Reply "SCAN ME" and I'll get started this week.

## Email 3: Backup & Disaster Recovery

**Subject:** What happens if your data disappears tomorrow?

---

[FIRST NAME],

**Uncomfortable question:** If all your company data vanished tomorrow, could you recover it?

**Scenario:**
- Fire destroys your office
- Ransomware encrypts your files  
- Hard drive fails
- Disgruntled employee deletes everything

How long until you're back in business? Hours? Days? Weeks?

**The truth:** 93% of companies that lose data for 10+ days file for bankruptcy within a year.

**Your backup system might be failing right now** (most businesses don't know until it's too late).

**What I can do:**
I'll run a **free backup audit** for [COMPANY NAME]:
- Test if your backups actually work
- Identify gaps in your recovery plan
- Calculate your exact recovery time
- Show you what you're not protecting

**This takes me 30 minutes. It could save your business.**

Reply with "AUDIT" and I'll schedule it this week.

## Email 4: Cost of Downtime

**Subject:** [COMPANY NAME] - Calculate your downtime cost

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

**Quick math exercise:**

How much revenue does [COMPANY NAME] generate per hour?

Now multiply that by 72 hours (the average time a small business is down after a major IT failure).

**That's your downtime cost.**

For most businesses, it's **$50,000-$500,000** in lost revenue, plus:
- Customer trust damage
- Employee productivity loss
- Emergency IT costs
- Potential legal liability

**The solution:** Proactive IT security and disaster recovery.

**Here's what I propose:**
Let me spend 5 days analyzing your IT infrastructure and show you:
1. Where you're vulnerable
2. What it would cost if systems failed
3. How to prevent expensive downtime
4. Exact ROI of fixing vs. risk of not fixing

**Investment:** $3,500  
**Potential savings:** $50,000-$500,000+

**Next step:**
15-minute call to see if this makes sense for [COMPANY NAME].

When's better - **Tuesday 2pm or Wednesday 10am**?
