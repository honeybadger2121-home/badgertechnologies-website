## Module 2: Network Fundamentals



### Learning Objectives

- Explain basic networking concepts to clients

- Identify common network problems

- Understand network security basics



### Key Concepts


**What is a Network?**
A network is a collection of computers and devices connected together to share resources and communicate.

**Network Types:**


1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**

   - Connects devices in a single location (office, building)
   - High speed, low latency
   - Example: Office network connecting all computers


2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

   - Connects multiple locations across distances
   - Uses internet or dedicated connections
   - Example: Company with offices in multiple cities


3. **Wireless Network (Wi-Fi)**

   - Provides network access without cables
   - Requires proper security (WPA3 encryption)
   - Should be separated for guests vs. employees

**Network Components:**

**Router**

- Connects your network to the internet

- Routes traffic between networks

- Often includes firewall capabilities


**Switch**

- Connects multiple devices within a network

- Directs traffic efficiently between devices

- Available in managed and unmanaged versions


**Access Point**

- Provides Wi-Fi connectivity

- Should be enterprise-grade for business use

- Requires proper configuration and security


**Firewall**

- Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic

- Blocks unauthorized access

- Essential security component



### Common Network Problems


**Problem: Slow Internet**
Possible Causes:

- Insufficient bandwidth for number of users

- Old or failing equipment

- Network congestion

- Malware or unauthorized usage


**Problem: Wi-Fi Dead Spots**
Solutions:

- Add additional access points

- Use mesh networking

- Relocate existing equipment

- Reduce interference


**Problem: Devices Can't Connect**
Troubleshooting:

- Check DHCP settings

- Verify network credentials

- Review firewall rules

- Check for IP conflicts



### Client Communication


**Explaining Networks in Simple Terms:**
"Your network is like your office's highway system. Routers are the on-ramps to the internet highway, switches are the intersections connecting different departments, and Wi-Fi access points are the parking lots where people can join the highway wirelessly."

**Business Value Points:**

- Reliable network = productive employees

- Proper network design supports growth

- Network security protects business data

- Modern networks enable remote work

## Module 3: Cybersecurity Essentials



### Learning Objectives

- Understand major cybersecurity threats

- Explain security layers and defense-in-depth

- Communicate security importance to clients



### Key Concepts


**The Threat Landscape**

Modern businesses face multiple cybersecurity threats:


1. **Ransomware**

   - Encrypts all business data
   - Demands payment for decryption key
   - Average ransom: $200,000+
   - Recovery time: 3-4 weeks
   - Many businesses never fully recover


2. **Phishing**

   - Fake emails pretending to be legitimate
   - Tricks users into revealing credentials
   - Most common attack vector (90% of breaches)
   - Getting more sophisticated with AI


3. **Malware**

   - Malicious software that damages systems
   - Includes viruses, trojans, spyware
   - Can steal data or create backdoors
   - Often delivered through email or websites


4. **Insider Threats**

   - Employees with malicious intent
   - Accidental data exposure
   - Lost or stolen devices
   - Weak password practices

**Defense-in-Depth Strategy**

Security should be layered, not relying on a single solution:

**Layer 1: Perimeter Security**

- Firewall (hardware or cloud-based)

- Email filtering and spam protection

- Web filtering to block malicious sites

- Intrusion detection/prevention systems


**Layer 2: Endpoint Protection**

- Enterprise antivirus/EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)

- Device encryption

- Application control (whitelist/blacklist)

- Patch management


**Layer 3: Access Control**

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

- Strong password policies

- Principle of least privilege

- Role-based access control


**Layer 4: Data Protection**

- Encryption at rest and in transit

- Regular backups (3-2-1 rule)

- Data loss prevention (DLP)

- Secure file sharing


**Layer 5: Human Layer**

- Security awareness training

- Phishing simulation tests

- Clear security policies

- Incident reporting procedures



### Critical Security Measures


**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
Requires two or more verification methods:

1. Something you know (password)

2. Something you have (phone, token)

3. Something you are (fingerprint, face)


**Why it matters:** Even if password is compromised, attacker can't access the account.

**Regular Backups**
Follow the 3-2-1 rule:

- 3 copies of data

- 2 different media types

- 1 offsite copy


**Test restores monthly** - backups are useless if they don't work when needed.

**Security Updates**

- Patch operating systems monthly (minimum)

- Update applications regularly

- Replace unsupported software

- Firmware updates for network equipment



### Client Scenarios


**Scenario: "We've never been hacked, why invest in security?"**

Response:
"That's like saying 'I've never had a house fire, why have smoke detectors?' Cyberattacks are increasing 300% year-over-year. The average cost of a data breach is $4.45 million. Most small businesses that suffer a major cyberattack go out of business within 6 months. Security is insurance for your business operations."

**Scenario: "Isn't antivirus enough?"**

Response:
"Modern antivirus is important, but it's just one layer. Think of it like a front door lock - necessary but not sufficient. Cybercriminals use multiple attack vectors. We need perimeter security (firewall), email filtering, employee training, backups, and more. It's called defense-in-depth."

**Scenario: "MFA is too inconvenient for our team"**

Response:
"I understand the concern. However, 99.9% of automated attacks are blocked by MFA. The 5 extra seconds to confirm on your phone beats the days or weeks of downtime from a breach. We can implement it gradually, starting with admin accounts and sensitive systems."


### Red Flags to Watch For


When talking to clients, these indicate security problems:

- No firewall or using ISP-provided router

- Shared admin passwords

- No backup testing or verification

- Employees using personal email for work

- No security training for staff

- Windows 7 or other unsupported systems

- No documentation of security policies

- Train users

- Monitor performance


**Phase 4: Optimization (Ongoing)**

- Review usage and costs

- Optimize resource allocation

- Implement additional features

- Continuous improvement



### Client Scenarios


**Scenario: "Cloud seems expensive compared to our current server"**

Response:
"Let's look at total cost of ownership. Your server cost $8,000, plus:

- $2,000/year in electricity and cooling

- $500/year for antivirus and updates

- $200/month for backup solution = $2,400/year

- Server replacement every 5 years = $1,600/year

- IT time for maintenance = $3,000/year


Total: $9,500/year for just the hardware. Cloud includes backups, security, updates, disaster recovery, and 99.9% uptime guarantee for about $6,000/year for your size."

**Scenario: "What if the cloud provider goes down?"**

Response:
"Major cloud providers like Microsoft have 99.9% uptime SLAs - that's less than 9 hours of downtime per year. Your on-premise server has no such guarantee. They have redundant datacenters, generators, multiple internet connections, and teams monitoring 24/7. When was the last time you tested YOUR backup generator or had someone monitoring your server at 3am?"

**Scenario: "Is our data secure in the cloud?"**

Response:
"Cloud providers invest millions in security - more than any small business could afford. They have:

- 24/7 security operations centers

- Advanced threat detection

- Compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)

- Encryption in transit and at rest

- Multi-factor authentication

- Geo-redundant backups


Your data is likely MORE secure in the cloud than in your office where anyone could unplug the server or steal a hard drive."

## Module 5: Data Backup & Recovery



### Learning Objectives

- Explain backup best practices

- Understand different backup methods

- Plan disaster recovery strategies



### Key Concepts


**The 3-2-1 Backup Rule**

**3** = Three copies of your data

- Original working data

- Local backup copy

- Offsite/cloud backup copy


**2** = Two different media types

- Hard drives

- Cloud storage

- Tape (for large enterprises)

- Never rely on just one type


**1** = One copy offsite

- Protection from physical disasters

- Fire, flood, theft protection

- Geographic redundancy



### Backup Types


**Full Backup**

- Copies everything

- Slowest to perform

- Fastest to restore

- Most storage space required

- Recommended: Weekly


**Incremental Backup**

- Only backs up changes since last backup

- Fast to perform

- Slower to restore (need all incrementals)

- Less storage space

- Recommended: Daily


**Differential Backup**

- Backs up changes since last full backup

- Moderate speed

- Moderate restore time

- Moderate storage needs

- Alternative to incremental


**Image Backup**

- Complete system image

- Includes OS, applications, settings

- Fastest disaster recovery

- Recommended for servers and critical workstations



### Recovery Time Objective (RTO) vs Recovery Point Objective (RPO)


**RTO: How long can you be down?**

- 4 hours RTO = Must be operational within 4 hours

- Determines backup method and infrastructure

- Faster RTO = higher cost


**RPO: How much data can you afford to lose?**

- 1 hour RPO = Lose at most 1 hour of work

- Determines backup frequency

- Lower RPO = more frequent backups needed


**Example Scenarios:**

Small retail shop:

- RTO: 24 hours (can operate manually for a day)

- RPO: 24 hours (daily backups acceptable)

- Solution: Nightly cloud backup


Accounting firm during tax season:

- RTO: 2 hours (critical business period)

- RPO: 1 hour (can't lose client data)

- Solution: Continuous replication + local backups



### Disaster Recovery Planning


**Common Disasters:**

1. Hardware failure (most common)

2. Ransomware/malware

3. Human error (accidental deletion)

4. Natural disaster (fire, flood)

5. Theft or vandalism

6. Power failure/electrical damage


**Recovery Steps:**

**Step 1: Assess the Situation**

- What failed?

- What data is affected?

- Is it isolated or widespread?


**Step 2: Activate Recovery Plan**

- Notify key personnel

- Document the incident

- Begin recovery procedures


**Step 3: Restore Operations**

- Restore from most recent backup

- Verify data integrity

- Test critical functions


**Step 4: Return to Production**

- Confirm everything works

- Document what happened

- Update procedures if needed


**Step 5: Post-Incident Review**

- What went wrong?

- How can we prevent it?

- Update disaster recovery plan



### Testing Backups


**Monthly Testing Minimum:**

1. Select random files

2. Perform test restore

3. Verify files open correctly

4. Document results


**Quarterly Full System Test:**

1. Restore complete server/system

2. Boot and verify functionality

3. Test user access

4. Measure recovery time

5. Document and improve



### Client Scenarios


**Scenario: "We back up to an external drive. Isn't that enough?"**

Response:
"That's a good start, but has two major risks. First, if your office floods, burns, or is broken into, that external drive is destroyed/stolen along with your server. Second, ransomware often encrypts external drives too. You need an offsite copy - cloud backup is perfect for this and costs about $100-200/month for most businesses."

**Scenario: "How often should we back up?"**

Response:
"Ask yourself: How much work can you afford to lose? If your computer died right now, how far back would you have to recreate? For most businesses, daily backups are minimum. Critical systems should backup hourly or use continuous replication. We typically recommend:

- Servers: Hourly incremental + nightly full

- Workstations: Daily

- Databases: Every 15-30 minutes

- Email: Continuous (via cloud)"


**Scenario: "We've been backing up for years and never tested a restore"**

Response:
"That's unfortunately common, but risky. About 30% of backups fail when actually tested. Imagine discovering your backups don't work AFTER a disaster. We include monthly test restores in our service to ensure your backups work when you need them. It's like a fire drill - practicing before the emergency."

## Module 9: Email Systems & Communication



### Learning Objectives

- Understand email infrastructure

- Troubleshoot common email problems

- Recommend email security measures



### Email Fundamentals


**How Email Works:**

1. You compose email in Outlook/Gmail

2. Email goes to your email server (SMTP)

3. Server looks up recipient's email server (DNS)

4. Email transfers to recipient's server

5. Recipient downloads from their server


**Email Protocols:**

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

- Sending email

- Port 25, 587, or 465

- Requires authentication


**POP3 (Post Office Protocol)**

- Downloads email to device

- Deletes from server (usually)

- Single device access

- Legacy protocol


**IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**

- Keeps email on server

- Syncs across devices

- Modern standard

- What we recommend


**Exchange/EAS (Exchange ActiveSync)**

- Microsoft protocol

- Email, calendar, contacts sync

- Business standard

- Used by Microsoft 365



### Email Security


**SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**

- DNS record listing authorized email servers

- Prevents spoofing

- Required for delivery


**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**

- Digital signature for emails

- Verifies sender identity

- Improves deliverability


**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)**

- Policy for failed SPF/DKIM

- Tells receiving servers what to do

- Required by major providers


**Spam Filtering**

- Blocks unwanted email

- Phishing protection

- Malware scanning

- Cloud-based recommended



### Common Email Problems


**Problem: Email not sending**
Causes:

- Incorrect SMTP settings

- Blocked by ISP

- Authentication failure

- Blacklisted IP address


**Problem: Email going to spam**
Causes:

- Missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC

- Shared IP reputation

- Content triggers spam filters

- New domain


**Problem: Emails delayed**
Causes:

- Server overload

- Greylisting by recipient

- Large attachments

- DNS issues


**Problem: Can't access email on phone**
Causes:

- Incorrect server settings

- Wrong protocol (use IMAP/Exchange)

- Password changed

- App-specific password needed



### Microsoft 365 Email Management


**Mailbox Features:**

- 50-100GB storage per user

- Shared mailboxes (free)

- Distribution lists

- Email aliases

- Archive mailboxes

- Retention policies


**Security Features:**

- Advanced threat protection

- Safe links (checks URLs)

- Safe attachments (sandbox)

- Anti-phishing

- Quarantine management


**Mobile Access:**

- Outlook mobile app

- Native iOS/Android mail

- Web access

- Calendar integration



### Client Scenarios


**Scenario: "Our email keeps going down. Can you help?"**

Response:
"On-premise email servers require constant maintenance and are single points of failure. I strongly recommend migrating to Microsoft 365:

- 99.9% uptime guarantee

- No server to maintain

- Better security

- Access from anywhere

- $6-12/user/month

- Migration takes 1-2 weeks

- Your current issues will disappear


What's your current email setup?"

**Scenario: "Customers say our emails go to spam"**

Response:
"Let me check your email authentication. [Check DNS records] You're missing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. This makes your email look suspicious. I can:

1. Add proper DNS records

2. Warm up your sending reputation

3. Review email content for spam triggers

4. Set up monitoring

5. Consider Microsoft 365 which handles this automatically


This should improve delivery within 2-4 weeks."

**Scenario: "Can employees use Gmail for work?"**

Response:
"They can, but it's risky:

- No control over data

- No backup

- Privacy concerns

- Unprofessional

- No compliance tools

- Could lose access if Google locks account


Business email with your domain (@yourcompany.com) is:

- More professional

- You control the data

- Better security

- Compliance-ready

- Only $6-12/user/month


The investment is worth the professionalism and control."

- Per employee: $3,000-5,000/year

- Includes possible full-time IT staff



### Capital vs Operational Expenses


**Capital Expenses (CapEx)**

- Large upfront purchases

- Depreciated over time

- Examples: Servers, major equipment

- Tax implications: Spread over years


**Operational Expenses (OpEx)**

- Monthly/annual recurring costs

- Immediate tax deduction

- Examples: Cloud services, subscriptions

- Trend: Moving from CapEx to OpEx


**Benefits of OpEx Model:**

- Predictable monthly costs

- Easier to budget

- No large upfront investments

- Always current technology

- Better tax treatment for many businesses



### Technology Refresh Cycles


**Workstations: Every 4-5 years**

- Year 0: Purchase ($800-1,200)

- Years 1-3: Low maintenance

- Year 4: Increase in issues

- Year 5: Replace before failure


**Annual Cost Calculation:**
$1,000 computer ÷ 5 years = $200/year per computer

**For 20 computers:**
Replace 4-5 per year = $4,000-5,000 annual budget

**Servers: Every 5-6 years**

- Or consider cloud alternative

- Budget $400-600/year per server for replacement

- Include migration costs


**Network Equipment: Every 5-7 years**

- Longer lifespan

- Budget $200-300/year for replacement



### ROI of IT Investments


**Downtime Costs:**

- Average: $5,600 per minute

- Per employee per hour: $100-300 in lost productivity

- One day outage for 20 employees: $16,000-48,000


**Security Investment ROI:**

- Average breach cost: $4.45 million

- Security investment: $10,000-30,000/year

- ROI: Avoiding one breach pays for 100+ years of security


**Cloud Migration ROI:**

- Eliminate server replacement: $8,000-15,000 every 5 years

- Reduce IT support time: $3,000-5,000/year

- Improve productivity: $5,000-10,000/year

- Payback period: Usually 1-2 years


**Productivity Tools ROI:**

- Microsoft 365 collaboration: 10% productivity gain

- For 20 employees at $50K salary: $100,000 value

- Cost: $3,000/year

- ROI: 33:1



### Client Scenarios


**Scenario: "IT seems expensive. Can we cut costs?"**

Response:
"Let's look at what you're really spending:

Current Costs:

- Reactive break-fix: $8,000/year (unpredictable)

- Downtime: 2 days/year = $15,000 in lost productivity

- No backups: Risking business (potential $500K+ loss)

- Total risk: $23,000+ annually


Our Managed Services:

- Proactive monitoring: Prevents issues

- 24/7 support: Minimize downtime

- Backups included: Protect your business

- Fixed monthly cost: $1,500/month = $18,000/year


You actually save $5,000/year AND reduce risk dramatically. The question isn't can you afford IT support, it's can you afford NOT to have it?"

**Scenario: "Why do we need to budget for replacement computers? These work fine."**

Response:
"Your computers are 6 years old. Here's what's happening:

- Security updates will stop in 1 year

- They're slowing down your team (estimated 20% productivity loss = $40,000/year)

- Repair costs increase significantly after year 5

- They're at high risk of sudden failure


By budgeting $4,000/year to replace 3-4 computers annually:

- Always have modern, fast computers

- Avoid emergency purchases

- Improve productivity

- Maintain security

- Spread the cost smoothly


Failing to plan = planning to fail. Sudden failures mean rush purchases and downtime."

**Scenario: "Can we just use free antivirus?"**

Response:
"Free antivirus is better than nothing, but:

Free Antivirus:

- Basic protection only

- No support

- No management

- Can't remove it remotely

- No reporting


Business Antivirus ($5-10/user/month):

- Advanced threat detection

- Ransomware protection

- Centralized management

- Support included

- Compliance reporting

- Remote deployment

- Automatic updates


For a 15-person company, we're talking $900-1,800/year for enterprise protection. One ransomware attack costs $200K+ average. The business-grade protection pays for itself if it stops one attack."

### Client Scenarios


**Scenario: "We're a medical office. Do we really need all this compliance stuff?"**

Response:
"HIPAA is federal law with serious penalties:

- Up to $50,000 per violation

- Maximum $1.5 million per year

- Potential criminal charges

- Loss of reputation


You're required to:

- Protect patient data

- Control access

- Encrypt data

- Have backup procedures

- Train employees

- Document everything


The good news: With proper IT setup, most compliance is automated. We'll:

- Set up encrypted email

- Implement access controls

- Configure secure backups

- Create required documentation

- Provide training materials

- Conduct annual risk assessments


Cost: $3,000-5,000 initial setup + monthly monitoring. Much less than a single HIPAA violation."

**Scenario: "We take credit cards. What do we need to do?"**

Response:
"PCI DSS compliance is required by card companies. The easiest approach:

Don't Store Card Data:

- Use Square, Stripe, or similar

- They handle compliance

- You only store transaction IDs

- Much lower compliance burden


If You Must Process Directly:

- PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaire

- Network segmentation

- Quarterly vulnerability scans

- Annual penetration test

- Firewall requirements

- Cost: $5,000-15,000/year


I strongly recommend using a payment processor. It's simpler, cheaper, and they assume most of the compliance burden."

**Scenario: "An employee left. What do we need to do?"**

Response:
"Proper offboarding is critical for security and compliance:

Immediate:

1. Disable all accounts (AD, email, systems)

2. Change any shared passwords they knew

3. Retrieve all company devices

4. Disable remote access (VPN, etc.)

5. Forward email to manager


Within 24 Hours:

1. Remove from all systems

2. Document offboarding in log

3. Review files for personal/unauthorized data

4. Audit their access over last 30 days


Within 30 Days:

1. Convert email to archive

2. Transfer OneDrive files to manager

3. Complete offboarding checklist


We can automate much of this with proper identity management."

## Module 12: Client Communication & Sales



### Learning Objectives

- Communicate technical concepts clearly

- Handle objections effectively

- Close IT consulting engagements



### Technical Translation


**Avoid Jargon:**
Bad: "We need to implement a VLAN to segment your network traffic and improve QoS for VoIP"

Good: "We'll set up your network so that phone calls always have priority, preventing choppy calls even when internet is busy"

**Use Analogies:**

- Firewall = Security guard checking IDs

- Backup = Insurance policy for your data

- VPN = Private tunnel through the internet

- Cloud = Renting space in a high-tech warehouse

- Server = Central filing cabinet everyone accesses


**Focus on Business Impact:**
Instead of: "This firewall has IPS/IDS capabilities"
Say: "This protects you from hackers trying to break in, like an alarm system for your network"

Instead of: "We'll set up RAID 5 for fault tolerance"
Say: "If a hard drive fails, your data stays safe and you keep working"


### Common Objections & Responses


**"It's too expensive"**

Response:
"I understand cost is a concern. Let's look at value:

- Current reactive approach: $8,000/year in break-fix

- Plus downtime: $15,000/year

- Total: $23,000/year with high risk


Our service:

- Proactive monitoring prevents issues

- Unlimited support

- All updates and patches included

- Business continuity planning

- $18,000/year with predictable costs


You actually save $5,000 annually and eliminate the stress of IT emergencies. Which approach makes better business sense?"

**"We're too small to need this"**

Response:
"Actually, small businesses are targeted more because:

- Hackers know you have less security

- One breach can put you out of business

- You can't afford downtime

- You don't have an IT department


That's exactly why professional IT support makes sense. We provide enterprise-level protection at small business prices. You get what Fortune 500 companies have, scaled for your size."

**"Our current person does this"**

Response:
"I respect that. Let me ask:

- What happens when they're sick or on vacation?

- Are they available 24/7 for emergencies?

- Do they keep up with latest security threats?

- Do you have documentation if they leave?

- Can they handle strategic planning?


We complement internal IT or provide complete coverage. Many clients keep their person for day-to-day items and use us for expertise, after-hours, and strategic planning. Would that model work for you?"

**"We haven't had problems"**

Response:
"That's great! But consider:

- 60% of small businesses close within 6 months of a major cyber attack

- Average cost of downtime: $5,600 per minute

- Ransomware attacks up 300% this year


IT is like insurance - you hope to never need it, but when you do, it's critical. Our proactive approach means you'll continue to not have problems. Isn't preventing issues better than fixing them after they happen?"

**"Let me think about it"**

Response:
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific concerns can I address to help your decision?

[Address their concerns, then:]

How about this: Let's start with a 90-day trial. We'll show you the value with no long-term commitment. If you're not completely satisfied, we part as friends. Fair enough?"


### Consultative Selling Process


**Step 1: Discovery (Assess)**
Ask questions:

- "Tell me about your business"

- "How many employees? How many devices?"

- "What's your biggest IT frustration?"

- "What happens when something breaks?"

- "How do you handle backups?"

- "Ever been hacked or had a scare?"


**Step 2: Pain Points (Build Value)**
Identify problems:

- Downtime causing lost revenue

- Security vulnerabilities

- Lack of remote work capability

- Slow performance hurting productivity

- No disaster recovery plan

- IT costs unpredictable


**Step 3: Solution (Prescribe)**
Present targeted solution:

- "Based on what you've told me..."

- "Here's what I recommend..."

- Address their specific pain points

- Show how you solve their problems

- Use their language and concerns


**Step 4: Investment (Not Cost)**
Frame as investment:

- "Your investment is $X per month"

- "This protects $Y in business assets"

- "ROI in Z months from productivity gains"

- "Prevents $X downtime costs"


**Step 5: Next Steps (Close)**
Assumptive close:

- "Let's get started with an assessment"

- "I'll send over the agreement today"

- "We can begin next week"

- "Sound good?"



### Building Trust


**Be Honest:**

- "I don't know, but I'll find out"

- "That's outside my expertise, but I know who can help"

- "This isn't the right solution for you"


**Under-Promise, Over-Deliver:**

- Say 3 days, deliver in 2

- Quote $1,500, charge $1,200

- Promise monitoring, include free security review


**Follow Through:**

- Call when you say you will

- Send proposals promptly

- Return emails within 4 hours

- Keep commitments


**Add Value:**

- Share relevant articles

- Offer free advice

- Make introductions

- Think long-term relationship



### Closing Tips


**Trial Close Throughout:**

- "Does that make sense?"

- "How does that sound?"

- "Would that solve your problem?"

- "Is that what you're looking for?"


**Handle Decision Makers:**

- "Who else is involved in this decision?"

- "What's your decision-making process?"

- "When are you looking to make a decision?"


**Create Urgency (Honestly):**

- "Security threats don't wait"

- "This quarter's special pricing ends..."

- "We have openings next week"

- "The sooner we start, the sooner you're protected"


**Make It Easy:**

- Simple agreements

- Flexible payment terms

- Clear next steps

- Quick start process



### Practice Scenarios


**Scenario 1:**
Client: "We just need someone to fix our computers when they break"

Your Response:
"I understand that's what you need right now. But let me ask - how much does it cost each time something breaks? Not just the repair, but the lost productivity while you wait? Most of our clients found that switching from reactive to proactive actually saved money AND eliminated the stress of emergencies. Can I show you what that looks like for your business?"

**Scenario 2:**
Client: "Your competitor quoted $500 less per month"

Your Response:
"I appreciate you shopping around - that's smart business. May I ask what their quote includes? [Review] I see. Our service includes X, Y, and Z which they don't offer. Those typically cost $X if purchased separately. But more importantly - who do you want answering the phone at 2am when your systems are down? We have 24/7 coverage and average 15-minute response time. Is saving $500/month worth the risk when your business is on the line?"

**Scenario 3:**
Client: "We need to talk to our partner/board/spouse first"

Your Response:
"Of course! What questions do you think they'll have that I can help you answer now? [Discuss] Also, I'd be happy to present to them directly if that helps. Would a brief call with all decision-makers make sense? I can explain the technology and answer their questions. When works for everyone?"
