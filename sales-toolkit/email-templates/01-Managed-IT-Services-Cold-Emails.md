## TEMPLATE 1: THE "IT HEADACHES" EMAIL

**Subject:** Are IT problems slowing down [COMPANY NAME]?

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Quick question: **How much time does your team waste each week dealing with IT problems?**

- Slow computers
- Network issues
- Email problems
- Software that won't work
- "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

**The average small business loses 20+ hours per week to IT frustration.**

That's half a full-time employee just dealing with technology problems.

**Here's a better way:**

Badger Technologies provides **all-inclusive managed IT services** for businesses like [COMPANY NAME]:

✓ **Unlimited helpdesk support** - Call/email anytime, we fix it  
✓ **Proactive monitoring** - We fix problems before you notice them  
✓ **Regular maintenance** - No more slow computers  
✓ **Strategic planning** - Technology that actually helps your business  

**One flat monthly rate. No surprises. No frustration.**

**Most clients save 40% compared to hiring in-house IT or calling repair shops.**

## TEMPLATE 2: THE "NO IT PERSON" EMAIL

**Subject:** [COMPANY NAME] - Who handles your IT?

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I work with a lot of [INDUSTRY] businesses, and I always ask:

**"Who's your IT person?"**

The answers I usually get:
- "We don't have one..."
- "My nephew helps us sometimes..."
- "We just call whoever's available when something breaks..."
- "I try to Google it myself..."

**Sound familiar?**

**Here's the problem with the "call someone when it breaks" approach:**

❌ You wait hours (or days) for help  
❌ You pay premium "emergency" rates  
❌ Issues aren't prevented, just fixed temporarily  
❌ No one is thinking strategically about your technology  

**There's a better (and cheaper!) way:**

**Badger Technologies Managed IT Services:**

Instead of REACTING to problems, we PREVENT them.

**What you get:**
- **Your own IT department** - At a fraction of the cost of hiring someone
- **Helpdesk support** - Call/email anytime, average 30-minute response
- **Proactive monitoring** - We see and fix issues before they affect you
- **Strategic guidance** - "Should we upgrade? What do we need? What's worth the investment?"
- **Predictable costs** - One monthly fee covers everything

**Pricing starts at $799/month** for businesses your size (that's less than $40 per employee!)

**Compare that to:**
- Emergency IT calls: $150-250/hour
- Hiring IT staff: $50,000-70,000/year
- Lost productivity: Priceless

**Want a free IT assessment and customized quote?**

Just reply "INTERESTED" and I'll reach out.

## TEMPLATE 4: THE "HIDDEN COSTS" EMAIL

**Subject:** [FIRST NAME] - The hidden cost of "cheap" IT

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

**Pop quiz:** What does IT support actually cost [COMPANY NAME]?

Most business owners say: **"Not much, we only call someone when something breaks."**

**Let's do the real math:**

**Direct costs:**
- Emergency IT calls: $150-250/hour × 10 hours/year = **$1,500-2,500**
- Computer that died and needs replacing: **$1,200**
- Software you had to buy because old version stopped working: **$600**
- **Total visible costs: ~$3,000-4,000/year**

**Hidden costs (the ones that really hurt):**
- Employee downtime waiting for IT help: 20 hours/year × $30/hour × 10 employees = **$6,000**
- Lost sales because systems were down: **$5,000+**
- Your own time spent "being IT": 40 hours/year × $100/hour = **$4,000**
- **Total hidden costs: ~$15,000/year**

**ACTUAL IT COST: $18,000-19,000/year**

**And you're STILL dealing with frustration, downtime, and reactive firefighting.**

---

**Now compare that to Badger Technologies Managed IT:**

**$1,299/month = $15,588/year**

**What you get for LESS money:**
✓ Unlimited helpdesk support  
✓ Proactive monitoring (problems fixed before they happen)  
✓ Regular maintenance  
✓ Strategic planning  
✓ Backup and disaster recovery  
✓ Cybersecurity included  
✓ No more downtime  
✓ No more emergency bills  
✓ No more IT headaches  

**You actually SAVE money AND get better service.**

**Want to see what this looks like for [COMPANY NAME]?**

## EMAIL BEST PRACTICES FOR MANAGED IT SALES

### **DO:**
✅ Focus on business outcomes (productivity, growth) not technical specs  
✅ Use pain points they recognize ("slow computers," "downtime")  
✅ Show total cost comparison (hidden costs vs. managed services)  
✅ Emphasize predictability (one monthly fee vs. surprise bills)  
✅ Position as partnership, not vendor  

### **DON'T:**
❌ Use too much technical jargon  
❌ Lead with price (lead with value)  
❌ Bash their current IT person  
❌ Make it sound complicated  
❌ Forget the call-to-action  

---

## RESPONSE HANDLING

### **"We already have someone who helps us with IT"**

**Response:**

"That's great! Can I ask - is it someone in-house, or do you call them when issues come up?

[Wait for answer]

The reason I ask is most small businesses use the 'call when broken' model, which works but has limitations:
- You wait for help instead of preventing issues
- You pay hourly rates that add up
- No one is thinking strategically about your technology

Our managed services complement or replace that reactive approach with proactive support - often for less than you're currently spending.

Worth a quick conversation to compare? No obligation."

---

### **"How much does it cost?"**

**Response:**

"Great question! Our managed IT packages range from $799 to $2,500/month depending on:
- Number of employees
- Complexity of your systems
- Level of support you need

Most businesses your size (around [X] employees) invest $1,200-1,500/month.

Here's the key: That's typically LESS than what they were spending on reactive IT (emergency calls, downtime, their own time fixing things).

Want me to put together a customized quote for [COMPANY NAME]? I can have it to you by tomorrow."

---

### **"We can't afford that right now"**

**Response:**

"I understand budget concerns. Quick question: What ARE you spending on IT right now?

Most businesses don't realize they're already spending $1,000-2,000/month on:
- Emergency IT calls ($150-250/hour)
- Employee downtime
- Lost productivity
- Your own time dealing with tech issues

Our managed services usually cost the same or LESS - but you get proactive support instead of reactive firefighting.

Worth looking at the numbers together? I can show you exactly what you're currently spending vs. what managed IT would cost."
