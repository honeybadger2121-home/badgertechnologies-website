## PRICING SCRIPTS



### **When They Ask "How Much?"**


**You:** "Great question! Our managed IT packages range from $799 to $2,999/month depending on your size and needs."

**You:** "For a business like yours with [X] employees, most clients choose our **Professional package at $1,499/month.**"

**You:** "That includes unlimited helpdesk support, proactive monitoring, on-site visits, cloud backup, and strategic IT planning."

**You:** "Compare that to what you're probably spending now on emergency IT calls, downtime, and your own time - most businesses find they actually SAVE money while getting better service."

**You:** "Want me to put together a customized quote showing exactly what you'd get?"

---


### **When They Say "That's Too Expensive"**


**You:** "I totally understand - $1,499/month sounds like a lot. Can I ask: What are you spending on IT right now?"

**[Listen to their answer]**

**You:** "Here's what most businesses don't realize they're actually spending:"

**You:** [Pull out calculator or notepad]


- "Emergency IT calls: About $500-1,000/month"

- "Downtime and lost productivity: $800-1,500/month"

- "Your time dealing with IT: $400-800/month"

- "That's $1,700-3,300/month you're already spending!"


**You:** "Our $1,499/month is usually LESS than you're spending now, but you get:"

- "No more downtime"

- "No more emergency bills"

- "No more frustration"

- "Plus strategic planning to prevent problems"


**You:** "Make sense?"

---


### **Justifying Monthly Recurring Cost**


**You:** "I know switching to a monthly service feels different than 'only calling when something breaks.'"

**You:** "But think of it like this:"

**Analogy 1 - Car Maintenance:**
"You wouldn't skip oil changes and only go to the mechanic when your engine dies, right? That's way more expensive."

"Same with IT - proactive maintenance prevents expensive emergencies."

**Analogy 2 - Health Insurance:**
"You don't cancel health insurance just because you're healthy. You keep it to prevent huge medical bills."

"Managed IT is insurance for your technology - prevents the huge bills."

**Analogy 3 - Gym Membership:**
"Paying monthly for the gym is cheaper than paying a personal trainer by the hour every time you want to work out."

"Same here - monthly IT is cheaper than hourly emergency calls."
