## SCRIPT 1: THE OPENER (Receptionist/Gatekeeper)

**[Walk in confidently, smile, make eye contact]**

**You:** "Hi! I'm Benjamin with Badger Technologies. Is [OWNER/DECISION MAKER] available for a quick 2-minute conversation?"

**Receptionist:** "What is this regarding?"

**You:** "I help businesses in [CITY/AREA] protect their data from cyber attacks. Just wanted to introduce myself since we're local. Is he/she available?"

---

### **If they say YES:**

**Receptionist:** "Let me check. One moment."

**You:** "Thank you!"

**[Wait patiently, stand rather than sit - shows you're not planning to stay long]**

---

### **If they say NO/BUSY:**

**Receptionist:** "He's with a client / in a meeting / not available."

**You:** "No problem! What's the best time to catch him/her? I can come back."

**Receptionist:** "Try calling to set an appointment."

**You:** "Perfect! Can I leave my card and a quick overview of what we do? When he/she sees the cost of a data breach, they usually want to talk."

**[Hand business card + one-pager]**

**You:** "I'll give him/her a call tomorrow. What's his/her direct line or email?"

**[Get contact info, thank them, leave]**

---

## SCRIPT 2: MEETING THE DECISION MAKER

**[Owner/Manager comes out to meet you]**

**You:** "Hi! Benjamin Sherman. Thanks for seeing me - I know you're busy, so I'll be quick."

**[Shake hands firmly, smile, maintain eye contact]**

**You:** "I run an IT security company here in [CITY]. We help businesses like yours prevent ransomware attacks and data breaches."

**[Pause - let them respond]**

---

### **Their Response Option 1: "We already have IT support"**

**You:** "That's great! Are they handling your security assessments and compliance requirements too?"

**Them:** "I think so..."

**You:** "Most IT companies focus on keeping things running, but security is a different specialty. **When was your last security assessment?"**

**[If they don't know or it's been 12+ months:]**

**You:** "Here's the thing - the average data breach costs $200,000 for a business your size. **For $3,500, I can show you exactly where you're vulnerable** and how to fix it before something happens."

**You:** "Can I send you more info? What's the best email?"

---

### **Their Response Option 2: "How much does this cost?"**

**You:** "Depends on your setup, but most businesses your size invest between **$3,500 and $8,500** for a complete security assessment."

**You:** "That might sound like a lot, but compare it to the **$200,000 average cost of a data breach**, not to mention the reputation damage and lost clients."

**You:** "Think of it as insurance - you pay a little now to avoid losing everything later."

**You:** "Want me to send over a quick proposal? I can have it to you by tomorrow."

---

### **Their Response Option 3: "I'm not interested"**

**You:** "No worries! Can I ask - is it because you're confident in your current security, or just not a priority right now?"

**Them:** "We're fine / Not a priority / Too expensive"

**You:** "I totally get it. **One question though:** If your business got hit with ransomware tomorrow and you were offline for a week, how much would that cost you?"

**[Let them think about it]**

**You:** "Just something to think about. Here's my card - when you're ready to make sure that never happens, give me a call."

**[Hand card, smile, leave on good terms]**

---

## SCRIPT 3: THE ELEVATOR PITCH (30 Seconds)

**Use this when:** Someone asks "What do you do?" or when you have limited time.

**You:** "I run Badger Technologies - we help small businesses protect themselves from cyber attacks."

"You know how ransomware can shut down a business for weeks and cost hundreds of thousands to recover from?"

"**We prevent that** by finding vulnerabilities before the hackers do. Security assessments, compliance audits, employee training - the whole package."

"Most businesses don't realize they're at risk until it's too late. We fix that."

**[Pause]**

**You:** "Do you ever worry about your business data getting hacked?"

---

## SCRIPT 4: OBJECTION HANDLING

### **Objection: "We can't afford it right now"**

**You:** "I understand budget concerns. Let me ask you this - can you afford to be offline for a week?"

**You:** "Here's what I recommend: Start with a **basic security assessment for $2,500**. That shows you exactly where you're at risk. Then you can prioritize and fix the critical stuff first."

**You:** "We can even break it into monthly payments. **Would $300/month work better** than $3,500 upfront?"

---

### **Objection: "We're too small to be targeted"**

**You:** "That's what most small businesses think - and that's exactly why hackers target them!"

**You:** "Big companies have huge security budgets. **Small businesses are easier targets** because they assume they're safe."

**You:** "43% of cyber attacks target small businesses. You're actually MORE at risk than larger companies."

**You:** "For $3,500, wouldn't you like to know for sure that you're protected?"

---

### **Objection: "I need to think about it"**

**You:** "Absolutely! This is an important decision. Can I ask what specifically you need to think about?"

**[Listen to their concern, address it]**

**You:** "Tell you what - let me email you some info about what we do and a couple case studies. No pressure, just so you can review it when you have time."

**You:** "What's the best email?"

**[Get email, follow up within 24 hours]**

---

### **Objection: "Just email me information"**

**You:** "Happy to! Before I send that over, can I ask two quick questions so I send you the right info?"

1. **"What's your biggest IT concern right now?"** (backup? compliance? security?)
2. **"Have you ever had a security incident or close call?"** (virus, ransomware attempt, breach)

**[Based on answers, customize your follow-up email]**

**You:** "Perfect! I'll send that over by end of day. **Can I follow up with you on Thursday** to see if you have any questions?"

---

## SCRIPT 5: THE CLOSE

### **Trial Close:**

**You:** "Based on what you've told me, I think a security assessment would be perfect for you. **Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?"**

---

### **Hard Close:**

**You:** "Here's what I'd like to do: Let me come back on **[DAY]** at **[TIME]** and do a quick 30-minute site survey. I'll see your setup and give you a ballpark quote. Sound good?"

---

### **Assumptive Close:**

**You:** "Great! I'm going to send you a proposal this afternoon. **Are you generally the final decision maker, or does someone else need to sign off?"**

---

### **Alternative Close:**

**You:** "I have openings this week on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning. **Which works better for you?"**

---

## SCRIPT 6: LEAVING ON GOOD TERMS

### **If they're not interested:**

**You:** "No problem at all! I appreciate your time. Here's my card - when things change or if you ever have questions about IT security, feel free to reach out."

**[Shake hands, smile]**

**You:** "By the way, if you know anyone who might need security help - other business owners, colleagues - I'd really appreciate the referral. We do great work and take care of people."

**[Leave]**

---

### **If they want to think about it:**

**You:** "Sounds good! I'll email you that info today. **Can I give you a call on Friday** to answer any questions?"

**Them:** "Sure" or "I'll call you if interested"

**You:** "Perfect! I'll send the email now and check in Friday. Thanks for your time!"

**[Leave]**

## REAL TALK: REJECTION IS NORMAL

**Expected conversion rates:**
- 20 visits = 12 conversations = 5 interested = 2 appointments = 1 sale

**That means 19 rejections to get 1 client.**

**Don't take it personally!** Most people will say no. That's okay. You only need a few yeses to build a thriving business.

## FIRST WEEK GOAL:

**Week 1 Target:**
- **100 businesses visited**
- **60 decision maker conversations**
- **20 follow-up emails sent**
- **5-10 appointments scheduled**
