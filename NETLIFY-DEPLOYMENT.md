### Phase 1: Deploy to Netlify (5 minutes)

   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "Sign up" (use GitHub, Google, or email)

2. **Deploy Your Site**
   - Click "Add new site" button
   - Select "Deploy manually"
   - **Drag and drop your entire `badgertechnologies.it.com` folder**
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site
   - You'll get a random URL like: `amazing-badger-123456.netlify.app`

3. **Test Your Site**
   - Click the generated URL to view your live website
   - Test all features: navigation, contact form, mobile responsiveness

### Phase 2: Connect Your Custom Domain (10 minutes)

1. **Add Custom Domain in Netlify**
   - In your Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings"
   - Click "Domain management" 
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter: `badgertechnologies.us`
   - Click "Add domain"

2. **Configure DNS at Your Domain Registrar**
   
   **If you bought from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.:**
   - Log into your domain registrar account
   - Find DNS Management/DNS Settings
   - Add these records:
   
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @ (or leave blank)
   Value: 75.2.60.5
   TTL: 300
   
   Type: CNAME  
   Name: www
   Value: amazing-badger-123456.netlify.app
   TTL: 300
   ```
   
   **Replace `amazing-badger-123456.netlify.app` with YOUR actual Netlify URL**

3. **Wait for DNS Propagation**
   - DNS changes take 5-48 hours (usually 1-2 hours)

   ```
   dns1.p01.nsone.net
   dns2.p01.nsone.net
   dns3.p01.nsone.net
   dns4.p01.nsone.net
