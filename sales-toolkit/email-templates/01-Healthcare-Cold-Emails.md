## Email 1: Complete IT Support for Healthcare


**Subject:** Your IT department - without the full-time cost

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I'm Benjamin Sherman with Badger Technologies, and I help healthcare practices like [COMPANY NAME] run smoothly without the headache of managing IT in-house.

Most medical practices face the same challenge: **You need reliable IT support, but can't justify hiring a full-time IT person at $70K/year.**

**That's where we come in:**

We become your complete IT department for a fraction of the cost:

- **Unlimited helpdesk support** - Your staff gets help when they need it

- **Proactive monitoring** - We fix problems before they disrupt patient care

- **HIPAA-compliant infrastructure** - Stay compliant without the complexity

- **EHR support** - Keep your practice management system running smoothly


**Your monthly investment:** Starting at $1,999/month (less than a part-time employee)

**What makes us different:**
We specialize in healthcare practices. We understand EHR systems, HIPAA requirements, and the unique technology challenges of running a medical office.

**Next step:**
I'd love to offer you a **complimentary IT assessment** (no obligation) where I'll:

- Review your current IT setup

- Identify ways to improve reliability and reduce downtime

- Show you exactly what managed IT support would look like for [COMPANY NAME]


Are you available for a 15-minute call this week?

## Email 2: IT Headaches Solution


**Subject:** Tired of IT problems disrupting patient care?

---

[FIRST NAME],

Quick question: How much time does your staff waste each week dealing with IT issues?


- Computers running slow?

- Email problems?

- EHR system acting up?

- Printers not working?

- No one to call for help?


**The harsh reality:**
Most medical practices handle IT one of three ways:

1. **"The computer person"** - Usually the office manager who "knows computers" (but isn't trained in IT)

2. **Break-fix IT** - Call someone when things break, pay $150/hour, wait days for help

3. **No plan at all** - Staff just "deals with it" and productivity suffers


**All three cost you more than you think.**

**What if IT just... worked?**

That's what we do at Badger Technologies. We become your complete IT department:

‚úì **Unlimited helpdesk** - Your staff emails or calls us, we fix it  
‚úì **Proactive monitoring** - We catch problems before they disrupt your day  
‚úì **Regular maintenance** - Updates, patches, optimization - all handled  
‚úì **HIPAA compliance** - We keep your patient data secure and compliant  
‚úì **Strategic planning** - We help you make smart technology decisions

**One monthly fee. No surprises. No more IT headaches.**

**Our healthcare clients tell us:**

- "I don't remember the last time we had an IT emergency"

- "My staff is so much more productive now"

- "It's like having an IT department for a fraction of the cost"


**Here's my offer:**
Let me run a **free IT health check** for [COMPANY NAME]. I'll show you:

- Where your current setup is costing you time and money

- How we'd keep your technology running smoothly

- Exactly what you'd pay (spoiler: less than you're spending now)


**Reply with "INTERESTED"** and I'll send you some time options.

No pressure, just helpful information.

## Email 3: ROI and Value Proposition


**Subject:** What if IT wasn't a headache anymore?

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Let me ask you something: **How much is unreliable IT costing your practice?**

Most practice managers don't realize the hidden costs:

ÔøΩ **Staff Time Wasted:** 5-10 hours/week troubleshooting IT = $15,000-$30,000/year  
üí∞ **Emergency IT Calls:** $150/hour √ó 15 calls/year = $2,250-$4,500/year  
üí∞ **Downtime:** 1 hour of EHR downtime = $500-$2,000 in lost productivity  
ÔøΩ **Security Risks:** HIPAA breach fines start at $25,000 per violation

**Total annual cost of "dealing with IT":** $30,000-$65,000

**Now compare that to managed IT support:**

**Your monthly investment: $1,999/month ($23,988/year)**

**What you get:**

- ‚úÖ Unlimited helpdesk support (email/phone/remote)

- ‚úÖ Proactive monitoring and maintenance

- ‚úÖ HIPAA-compliant infrastructure and policies

- ‚úÖ EHR system support and optimization

- ‚úÖ Monthly technology reviews

- ‚úÖ Priority response times (2-4 hours)

- ‚úÖ Cloud backup and disaster recovery

- ‚úÖ Staff training and documentation

- ‚úÖ Strategic technology planning


**Why healthcare practices choose us:**

üè• **Healthcare-Focused** - We understand medical practice workflows  
‚ö° **Fast Response** - We know downtime costs you money  
üîí **HIPAA Experts** - Compliance built into everything we do  
üì± **Modern Approach** - Cloud, mobile, telehealth - we get it  
ü§ù **True Partnership** - We're invested in your success

**The math is simple:**

- Hiring full-time IT: $70,000-$100,000/year + benefits

- Break-fix IT support: $30,000-$65,000/year (unpredictable)

- **Badger Technologies: $23,988/year (predictable, comprehensive)**


**Next step:**
I'd love to schedule a **15-minute consultation** to:

- Understand your specific technology challenges

- Show you exactly how managed IT would work for [COMPANY NAME]

- Provide a custom quote based on your practice size


**When works better - Thursday at 2pm or Friday at 10am?**

Looking forward to making IT stress-free for your practice.

## Email 4: Referral and Social Proof


**Subject:** How [SIMILAR PRACTICE] eliminated IT headaches

---

[FIRST NAME],

Last month, I started working with [SIMILAR PRACTICE NAME] here in [CITY].

**Their situation before us:**

- Office manager was "the IT person" (but had no IT training)

- Spent 10+ hours/week troubleshooting computers and network issues

- Called expensive break-fix IT whenever something major broke

- Worried constantly about HIPAA compliance

- Had no backup plan if their server failed


Sound familiar?

**Here's what changed in 30 days:**

‚úÖ Staff IT complaints dropped by 90%  
‚úÖ EHR system runs 40% faster (we optimized it)  
‚úÖ Office manager got 10 hours/week back to do her actual job  
‚úÖ HIPAA-compliant backup and disaster recovery in place  
‚úÖ 24/7 monitoring prevents problems before they start  

**Their monthly investment:** $1,999/month

**What they told me:**
*"I wish we'd done this years ago. The stress relief alone is worth it, and we're actually saving money compared to what we were spending on emergency IT calls."*

**The question for you:**
Is [COMPANY NAME] dealing with similar IT frustrations?

If so, let's talk. I'd love to offer you the same **free IT assessment** we gave them, where I'll:

- Evaluate your current technology setup

- Identify quick wins and long-term improvements

- Show you exactly what managed IT would look like for your practice

- Provide a custom quote (no obligation)


**Reply "YES"** and I'll send you a calendar link to pick a time that works.

Don't spend another year fighting with technology.

- ‚úÖ **HIPAA compliance** - "Stay compliant without the complexity"

### **Next Steps After They Respond:**

3. **Send calendar invite immediately** with clear agenda

### **Common Objections and Responses:**


**"We already have an IT person/company"**

- "That's great! How's that working out? Are you getting proactive support or just reactive fixes?"

- "Many of our best clients came from other IT providers who were just break-fix, not true partners."

- "Would you be open to a second opinion? Sometimes fresh eyes catch things others miss."


**"That seems expensive"**

- "I understand. Let me ask - what are you spending now on IT between staff time, emergency calls, and downtime?"

- "Most practices find they're actually spending MORE on reactive IT than our proactive support costs."

- "Think of it this way: $1,999/month is less than a part-time employee, and you get a whole IT department."


**"We're too small to need managed IT"**

- "Actually, smaller practices benefit the most! You don't have an IT department, so you need us even more."

- "Our Essential package is designed specifically for practices your size, starting at $799/month."

- "What's your plan if your server crashes tomorrow? Managed IT gives you peace of mind."


**"We'll think about it"**

- "Of course! What specific concerns do you need to think through?"

- "Would it help if I sent you some case studies from similar practices?"

- "How about this - let me do a free assessment, and you can make an informed decision with real data?"


**"We need to talk to our doctor/partner first"**

- "Absolutely! I can schedule a call with you both, or I can send you a proposal you can review together."

- "What would make them most comfortable? A quick intro call, or detailed information they can review?"

**Pro Tip:** Send these from your personal email - it gets higher open rates than generic "sales@" or "info@" addresses.
