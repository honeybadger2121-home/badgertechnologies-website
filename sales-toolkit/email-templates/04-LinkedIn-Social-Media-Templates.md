## LINKEDIN MESSAGES (AFTER CONNECTION ACCEPTED)

**Send 24-48 hours after they accept your connection request**

### **Message 1: Value First**

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Thanks for connecting! 

I saw you're [TITLE] at [COMPANY]. I work with businesses in [INDUSTRY] to prevent ransomware attacks and data breaches.

**Quick question:** When was the last time [COMPANY] had a comprehensive security assessment?

Most businesses haven't had one in 12+ months (or ever!) - which is like driving without insurance.

**I'd love to send you a free security checklist** specifically for [INDUSTRY] companies. No strings attached - just genuinely useful info.

Interested?

### **Message 2: Case Study Share**

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Hope you're doing well!

I just helped a [INDUSTRY] company similar to [COMPANY] identify 23 critical vulnerabilities that could have shut them down.

**The scary part:** They thought their IT was "fine." They had no idea they were one ransomware attack away from losing everything.

**Total cost to fix:** $7,200  
**Potential breach cost prevented:** $250,000+

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to discuss how we could do the same for [COMPANY]?

Happy to work around your schedule.

## LINKEDIN POSTS (BUILD YOUR AUTHORITY)

**Post 2-3x per week to stay visible**

### **Post Type 1: Scary Stat**

---

**43% of cyber attacks target SMALL businesses.**

Why?

Because they assume they're "too small" to be targeted.

That's EXACTLY what hackers are counting on.

**The truth:**
- Small businesses have weak security
- They often have valuable data (customer info, financial records)
- They can't afford big security teams

**You're not too small. You're the perfect target.**

**Don't wait for a breach to take security seriously.**

### **Post Type 2: Client Success Story**

---

**Just helped a medical practice avoid a $200,000+ disaster.**

**Here's what happened:**

They called me after seeing ransomware news stories. "We just want to make sure we're safe."

**What we found:**
- Outdated firewall (5 years old!)
- No employee security training
- Backups that hadn't been tested in 2 years
- Admin passwords like "Admin123"

**Translation:** They were one phishing email away from being shut down.

**What we did:**
- Updated firewall rules
- Implemented employee training
- Fixed backup system
- Enforced strong passwords

**Cost:** $7,200  
**Time:** 10 days  
**Peace of mind:** Priceless

**Don't wait for a breach. Get ahead of it.**

### **Post Type 3: Myth-Busting**

**MYTH:** "We're too small to be hacked."

**REALITY:** You're the EASIEST target.

**MYTH:** "Our IT company handles security."

**REALITY:** IT support ‚â† IT security. Different specialties.

**MYTH:** "We can't afford cybersecurity."

**REALITY:** You can't afford NOT to. Average breach costs $200K+.

**MYTH:** "We haven't been hacked yet, so we're fine."

**REALITY:** You probably don't know if you've been breached. Most breaches go undetected for 200+ days.

**Stop believing myths. Start protecting your business.**

**5 Signs You Need a Security Assessment (RIGHT NOW)**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **You don't know** - Can't answer "Are we secure?" with 100% confidence

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Last assessment 12+ months ago** - Threats evolve FAST

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Employee turnover** - Former employees might still have access

4Ô∏è‚É£ **New compliance requirements** - HIPAA, PCI, SOC 2 getting stricter

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Business growth** - More employees = more vulnerabilities

**How many apply to your business?**

If it's 2+, let's talk.

### **Post Type 5: Personal Story**

**Why I got into cybersecurity (and why it matters to YOU):**

A friend's small business got hit with ransomware. They lost EVERYTHING.

**Their story:**
- 15 employees
- 20 years in business
- $50,000 ransom demand
- 3 weeks offline
- Had to lay off 8 people
- Almost went bankrupt

**The worst part?** It was 100% preventable.

That's when I decided to specialize in helping SMALL businesses protect themselves BEFORE disaster strikes.

**Because prevention is cheaper than recovery.**

**My mission:** Make sure no small business owner goes through what my friend did.

**If you're worried about your business security, let's talk.**
