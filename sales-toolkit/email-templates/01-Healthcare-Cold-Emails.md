Hi [FIRST NAME],

I'm Benjamin Sherman with Badger Technologies, and I specialize in IT security assessments for healthcare organizations in [CITY/AREA].

I noticed [COMPANY NAME] and wanted to reach out because **HIPAA compliance failures** are costing healthcare practices an average of $4.35 million per breach in 2025.

**Here's what we do differently:**
- 5-day comprehensive security assessment using enterprise tools

- Vulnerability scanning and risk prioritization
- Clear, actionable remediation roadmap

**Special offer for [COMPANY NAME]:**
I'd like to offer you a **complimentary 1-hour security consultation** (normally $500) where I'll:
- Review your current IT security posture
- Identify your top 3 vulnerabilities
- Provide immediate recommendations you can implement

No obligations, no sales pitch - just actionable insights.

Are you available for a 15-minute call this week to discuss?

Best regards,

## Email 2: Pain Point Focus

**Subject:** Is your patient data really secure?

---

[FIRST NAME],

Quick question: When was the last time you had a comprehensive IT security assessment?

If it's been more than 6 months (or never), you could be sitting on **critical vulnerabilities** that put patient data at risk.

**The harsh reality:**
- 93% of healthcare organizations have experienced a data breach
- Average cost per breach: $4.35M
- Most practices don't know they're vulnerable until it's too late

**What we do:**
At Badger Technologies, we run **5-day security assessments** specifically designed for healthcare practices. We use the same tools Fortune 500 companies use - OpenVAS, PRTG, Azure Migrate - but at prices medical practices can actually afford.

**Our typical findings:**
‚úì Unpatched systems with known exploits  
‚úì Weak password policies  
‚úì Missing encryption on patient data  
‚úì No disaster recovery plan  
‚úì Shadow IT devices on the network

**Here's my offer:**
Let me run a **free 1-hour security checkup** for [COMPANY NAME]. I'll show you exactly where your vulnerabilities are and what it would cost to fix them.

No charge, no commitment. Just valuable insights.

Reply with "Interested" and I'll send you some available times.

## Email 4: Social Proof & Urgency

**Subject:** How [COMPETITOR] improved their security in 5 days

---

[FIRST NAME],

Last month, I helped [COMPETITOR/SIMILAR PRACTICE] identify **23 critical vulnerabilities** that could have led to a massive HIPAA violation.

They thought their IT was "good enough." It wasn't.

**Here's what we found:**
- 12 unpatched servers with known exploits
- Patient data transmitted without encryption
- 8 unauthorized devices on their network
- No backup or disaster recovery plan
- Administrator passwords written on sticky notes

**Total time to identify:** 5 days  
**Cost to fix:** $8,500  
**Potential breach cost avoided:** $2.3 million+

**The reality check:**
If the OCR (Office for Civil Rights) audited them before we did this assessment, they'd be facing **massive fines** and **reputation damage**.

**Here's my question for you:**
How confident are you that [COMPANY NAME] would pass a surprise HIPAA audit today?

If you're anything less than 100% certain, we should talk.

I'm offering a **free 30-minute security review call** where I'll:
- Ask you 10 critical questions about your current setup
- Identify your biggest risks
- Give you 3 things you can do THIS WEEK to improve security

**Reply with "YES"** and I'll send you a calendar link.

Don't wait for a breach to take security seriously.
